    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, my name is Roy. I'm an engineer on the Camera Software team. Today I will be walking you through some exciting photo quality improvements we made with our most popular video formats, and how your applications can make use of them to deliver an even better experience. iPhone is the most popular camera in the world, and for many years, developers have been taking advantage of its powerful camera systems to provide a diverse set of world-class experiences, from professional photography apps to video streaming tools. Different scenarios call for different levels of photo quality. For example, apps dedicated to taking still photos will demand the absolute best quality that the cameras can provide. A social app, on the other hand, might need to apply face effect overlays on top of the video frames being streamed. And this custom rendering might be computationally expensive. In order to avoid frame drops, the developer might prefer lower resolution frames so there are fewer pixels to process per frame. This diversity in use cases calls for an easy way to specify where you want to land on the scale of quality versus performance. Before we dive into photo quality, however, let's have a brief refresher on how photos are taken on iOS in general. We will start with an AVCaptureSession object, around which we can build our object graph. Since we are taking photos, we will use a camera as our AVCaptureDevice. Then, an AVCaptureDeviceInput is instantiated based on that device, and it will provide input data to the session.",

In this session, my colleague Ravi and I are going to show you some of the new advancements to ship your new or existing precompiled GPU code. This talk will consist of four parts. First up I'll provide an overview of Metal's current Shader compilation model. Next I'm going to introduce Metal Binary Archives, a new way for you to take control over shader caching, and ship precompile GPU executables to your users. I'm excited to share the new support for dynamic libraries in metal. This feature will allow you to link your compute shaders against utility libraries dynamically. And finally Ravi will present in detail the set of tools that you have in your We'll begin with a review of the shader and pipeline compilation process on Apple platforms. As you know the metal shading language is our programming language for shaders. Metal compiles this code into Apple's Intermediate Representation also known as AIR. This can be done off-line, in Xcode, or at runtime on the target device itself. Building off-line avoids the runtime cost of compiling source code to AIR. In both cases, however when creating pipeline state objects. this intermediate representation is further compiled on device to generate machine specific code needed for each particular GPU. This process occurs for every pipeline state. To accelerate recompilation and recreation of pipelines we cache the Metal Function variants produced in this step for future pipeline creation. This process is great, and has served us well of building pipeline objects early on to provide a hitch-free experience, this process can potentially result in long loading screens. Additionally under this model apps are unable to re-use any previously generated machine code subroutines across different pipeline state objects. We've gathered feedback coming in from our ecosystem of developers and have been able to identify a concrete set of needs that would enable you to address these challenges. You might want a way to save the entire time cost of pipeline state compilation, from source, to AIR, to a GPU binary. You might also want a mechanism that enables sharing common subroutines and utility functions without the need of compiling the same code twice or having it loaded in memory more than once.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Voiceover: Hello, and welcome to WWDC. Udayan Kale: Hi, everyone. I'm Udayan Kale. I am on the Game Center Engineering team. In this session, we will be talking about all the new features and Games Center leaderboards, achievements, and multiplayer. So let's talk about Game Center leaderboards. I will do a quick recap of Game Center leaderboards and then show you everything that's new this year. Leaderboards have always been an integral part of Game Center. A leaderboard is driven by scores and ranks players based on these scores. Players can view their friend and global ranks and challenge other players to beat their scores. You can share leaderboards across versions of your games on iOS, tvOS, and macOS. Game Center provides a lot of choices when it comes to contributing leaderboards and setting the score format, scoring types, and sort order. Game Center leaderboards have always been the traditional nonexpiring type. They maintain players codes and rankings forever. We now refer to these leaderboards as classic leaderboards. Here are a few examples. A gamer wants to keep track of the overall total number of experience points earned by players, or the most points ever collected, or the shortest time taken to complete a game level. These are all good use cases for classic leaderboards. So what's new this year? We now have a new type of leaderboard called recurring leaderboards. We have also completely redesigned the in-game UI, and we have a new set of APIs to access leaderboard data and submit scores. I will go over the new UI and APIs later. For now, let's look at recurring leaderboards. Recurring leaderboards are short-lived leaderboards that repeat on a periodic basis. These leaderboards would be great if your game wants to support periodic timed events. Here are some good use cases. You want your game to run a fifteen minute competition every hour, or you want to host a one-hour challenge every Sunday at noon, or you just want to run a new leaderboard each week. A recurring leaderboard will give your players a fresh start start every time to complete for top spots. Here is a deeper look at how Game Center recurring leaderboards work. A recurring leaderboard is a sequence of individual time data boards that start and end on a periodic basis. We call each of these individual leaderboards an occurrence. These occurrences are short-lived and do not overlap. Each new occurrence begins only after the current one ends. You configure a recurring leaderboard using a set of parameters in App Store Connect. Initial start date defines when your leaderboard would start creating occurrences. Frequency specifies the rate at which occurrences repeat, and duration specifies the time during which scores can be submitted to an active occurrence. You can introduce a time delay between occurrences using different values for frequency and duration. Each occurrence also maintains information about the start date of the next occurrence. So you know exactly when the next one begins. You can access each occurrence through an instance of the GKLeaderboard class. So let me show you how to configure the examples I mentioned earlier. In the first example you have a 15-minute competition every hour at the top of the hour. You configure this leaderboard with a desired initial startdate, a 60-minute frequency, and a 15-minute duration. The second example describes a one-hour contest every Sunday at noon. You set the start date, a frequency of seven days, and a duration of 60 minutes. The third example shows a recurring leaderboard that runs daily with no gaps between occurrences. And to ensure that occurrences do not overlap, the duration must not be greater than the frequency. Now that you know how recurring leaderboards are configured, let's talk about incorporating leaderboards in your game. The whole purpose of adding leaderboards to your game is to capture scores earned by players and display the scores so players can see their rankings. I will now show you how to submit scores to leaderboards. Submitting scores to a classic leaderboard is easy because a classic leaderboard never ends. You just call the submit score method passing in a score, a context, player, and one or more leaderboard IDs. Context is an optional value that you can associate with this code. The leaderboard will retain either the best score or the most recent score. For recurring leaderboards, scores can only be submitted to the currently active occurrence. You have two ways to submit scores to a recurring leaderboard. The first is to use the same method that we used for classic leaderboards. The score will be posted to the currently active occurrence, if one exists at the time of submission. The second option is to use a method on the GKLeaderboard instance that corresponds to an occurrence. As long as that occurrence is active, score submissions will succeed. You can query the start date and duration properties of GKLeaderboard to determine if the occurrence is active. Game Center defers forwarding scores to the server if the device is offline. The server validates a score based on the time it's received and not when it was earned by the player. So it's possible that an active leaderboard occurrence may have expired when the score reaches the server. Next let's talk about displaying leaderboards in your game. You have two options when it comes to showing leaderboards from within your game: using GameKit's new in-game UI or displaying your own custom UI. I strongly recommend using GameKit's in-game UI, as it's very easy to adopt and does most of the heavy lifting for you. For this, you will use the GKGamesCenterViewController class that you may already be familiar with. In the previous session, I showed you how to invoke Game Center dashboard. I will now show you how to directly display a list of leaderboards from within your game. You can see here, I initialize the GKGameCenterViewController, specifying the leaderboards state. This gives you a list of leaderboards that you see here on the right. At this point, the user can navigate to a particular leaderboard that they are interested in and select it. That will display the scores for that leaderboard. On the scores view, players can see how they rank against friends, recently played, and global players. They can use the filter in the header area to change their time scope for classic leaderboards or the occurrence for recurring leaderboards. And they can scroll to the top of the list by just tapping on the name in the header. You can even deep link to a specific leaderboard to directly display scores. So here, I have initialized GKGameCenterViewController with a leaderboard ID, a player scope, and a time scope. You get the scores view that you see on the right. So you see, adopting Game Center's in-game UI is that easy. But if you want to draw your own UI, you have to load the leaderboards and scores programmatically. We have introduced new APIs to work with leaderboards and scores, and you can read about them in the developer docs. Recurring leaderboards need special handling when dealing with occurrences. When you load a recurring leaderboard, only the current occurrence is loaded. You can use this current occurrence to load a previous one by calling the method, loadPreviousOccurrence, as shown here. Here are some considerations to keep in mind when loading previous occurrences. Game Center keeps expired occurrences around for up to 30 days from their expiry. However, a signed in player can view scores only on the current occurrence and one previous occurrence. The previous occurrence is usually the most recent expired occurrence in which the player submitted a score. In the example shown here, player one can view the scores on the current occurrence 53 and the previous occurrence 50. If a player never submitted a score to an occurrence, or if that occurrence was purged, then the immediate previous occurrence is accessible. So in the case of Player 2, they can view occurrences 53 and 52. If no occurrence is currently active, the most recent occurrence is still considered current for accessing scores. Next let's talk about setting up the leaderboards in App Store Connect. This screen shows the leaderboard for a typical game in App Store Connect. Most of the setup involving leaderboards, sets, and groups is the same as before and is common to both classic and recurring leaderboards. I would now show you the additional configuration you will need for recurring leaderboards. To add a new leaderboard, just click the plus icon next to the section title. When the pop up that shows, choose the type of leaderboard you wish to create. Your game can have just classic leaderboards, or just recurring leaderboards, or a combination of both. Once you select the type of leaderboard, you need to configure it. For both classic and recurring leaderboards, you must populate the section at the top. This is the same as you do today. The section at the bottom is only available for recurring leaderboards. The start date and time specifies when your leaderboard will start creating occurrences. The duration is a time interval during which scores can be submitted to an occurrence, and restart period specifies how frequently new occurrences will be created. The duration and restart period are both specified in minutes, hours, or days. The restart period must be equal to or larger than the duration, so occurrences do not overlap. Once you have configured a leaderboard, you must localize it. Both classic and recurring leaderboards have the same options when adding languages. We strongly recommend that you upload an image for your leaderboard that reflects some aspect of your game. This image is prominently displayed in the in-game UI. So that's it for Game Center leaderboards this year. We cannot wait to see games adopting these new features in various creative ways. Next up is achievements. And for that, let me welcome Dersu. Thank you! Dersu Abolfathi: Thank you, Udayan. Let's talk about achievements in Game Center. So what is an achievement? An achievement is a collectible item indicating the player has successfully reached a particular goal in your game. Achievements have been a fundamental part of Game Center since its inception, as they provide players an additional way of engaging with the game, tracking gameplay progress, and sharing that progress with friends. Players will notice a fresh, new, and consistent look to achievement badges. As the developer, you define the achievements available for players to work towards. An achievement will appear to players in one of four forms: locked, in-progress, completed, or hidden. Before the player has made any progress toward achievement, it will appear locked. Some players will often scan the achievements list and browse locked achievements as a guide for what they should do in your game. In this sense, your achievements list gives you an opportunity to tell users what to think about while playing your game. After you start reporting progress for a user toward some achievement, it will display as in-progress. Once you report 100 percent progress for that achievement, it is considered complete. At this point, the user will see the image tied to the achievement, and it will show up in their list of completed achievements. Last, you can explicitly mark an achievement as hidden until the player has completed it. You might do this if you feel the achievement description itself prematurely reveals aspects of the game's story or plot. Alternatively, consider using hidden achievements to surprise, delight, or humor the player. For example you might include a hidden achievement that rewards the player for failing spectacularly. This year we're bringing achievements to more places, including the Game Center Dashboard on iOS, macOS, and tvOS. The dashboard is a brand new area for players to view Game Center related information for your game. It's accessible straight from your game, and it showcases your game's achievements, personalized according to the player's progress. This means it's as important as ever to make sure your achievements are engaging, accessible, and interesting for players. For some useful tips and best practices for building achievements, we recommend you check out this year's session Design for Game Center. Before finalizing your achievements design, it's important to keep in mind that there are some limits to how many you can include in your game. Your game can have a maximum of 100 achievements, each of which can award up to 100 points, and overall, your game can award up to 1000 points. You want to make sure you make the most of this budget, creating a set of achievements that require a range of skills and dedication to complete. Finally, you should keep these limits in mind when shipping the initial version of your game, as you may want to create new achievements for future updates. After you've designed some achievements, you're probably ready to start integrating them into your game. And there are three simple steps needed to do this. First you'll need to authenticate the local player. Without first authenticating, any API calls you make to GameKit will result in an error. For more on using the local player, refer to the session Tap into Game Center dashboard access point and profile. Next, you need to report the player's progress to GameKit. As long as GameKit maintains a progress of zero for an achievement, it's going to appear to the player as locked. But the most interesting part of achievements happens when the player makes progress in your game. You'll notice in-progress achievements have been completely redesigned. Game Center will present players with this brand new styling, which features a progress circle, enticing them to get back into your game. Unsurprisingly, reporting achievement progress is done through the GKAchievement class. Every achievement has a unique identifier, which you use to initialize the GKAchievement. Anytime the player makes progress towards that achievement, it's important to update that percentComplete property. Finally, you can call the report method to register that change and handle any potential errors. Now, the player will see their achievement progress update anywhere they see this achievement, and they will unlock its imagery if it's completed. Finally, let's talk about how we can show the player their achievements. Achievements have a brand new home in the Game Center in game dashboard. If you integrate the new access point, this dashboard is just one tap away for the player and your game. The Achievements tab is front and center, giving players a one stop shop for viewing all things achievements. Inside this tab the summaries give the player a high-level view of how they're doing in your game. But players can dive deeper, scanning through the achievements they've already collected, as well as previewing the ones they are working on, and some others that you've got in store for them. While the player can reach this page from the dashboard, you can also present it directly with API. Doing so is done using the GKGameCenterViewController. You can initialize it with an achievement state and optionally assign the gameCenterDelegate property on the viewController. With just these few lines of code, You'll guide players into the all-new achievements page for your game. This UI provides a clean and consistent window into your game's achievements, so it will be the preferred experience for the vast majority of games. For those any need to customizer achievements display in their own UI, this can be done using the GKAchievementDescription class. Like GKAchievement, which is what you use to update the player's progress, this class has an identifier, but it also has the achievements title as well as separate descriptions for when the achievement is unachieved and achieved. It's important to note that the title and descriptions associated with this class are localized according to the players' localization preferences. As the game developer, you will make sure that all the relevant translations are included when you set up an achievement in App Store Connect. But when interacting with the achievement descriptions, GameKit will give you strings that are ready to display to the player. And finally there are also APIs for accessing achievement images for the achieved and nonachieved cases. So we've talked a bit about how to design achievements that work well for your game. We've also shown how to work with GameKit to view and update players progress. But before you can submit an achievements-ready build of your game to the App Store, you'll need to configure those achievements in App Store Connect. To do so, go to the Features tab of your games page on App Store Connect. Then after selecting the Game Center section, you'll see an Achievement section. To add an achievement for your game, you can click the plus button. This will bring up the add achievement screen. The achievement ID must be unique to this achievement. And as you saw on the previous code sample, is used to initialize your GKAchievement object. You also have to configure a few attributes such as: point value, whether it's hidden until achieved, and whether the player can earn the achievement multiple times. These values will be reflected in the GKAchievement class we discussed earlier in the session. We can finish adding this achievement and after we're done, our build is ready to deliver to users. Now I'm going to hand it over to Christy to talk about multiplayer gaming.",

    "video_transcript": "Hello, and welcome to WWDC. My name’s John, and I work on Core ML, Apple’s machine learning framework. Together with my colleague Brian, we're excited to show you how to tune up your models as you bring the magic of machine learning to your apps. To start things off, I’m going to show you some enhancements to our machine learning APIs. After that, we’ll dive into file format improvements that open up a range of new possibilities. Later on, Brian will show us ML Programs and take us under the hood and walk us through typed execution and how you can use it to fine-tune the accuracy and performance of your models. You can use these improvements to streamline your workflow and push your ML-powered experiences even further. Let’s start with the API improvements. Core ML provides you with a simple API to work with models on your user’s device. These models can be designed to work with a variety of inputs and outputs, such as strings or primitive values or more complex inputs like images and MultiArrays. Let’s talk more about this last type, MultiArray. Core ML makes it easy to work with multidimensional data using MLMultiArray. While it’s a simple API, the code you have to write to manipulate data with it doesn't always feel natural in Swift. For example, to initialize a MultiArray with a bunch of integers, you have to pass in the type at runtime. Plus you have to use NSNumber instead of regular integers, and that’s not type-safe and doesn’t really look like elegant Swift. Core ML is introducing MLShapedArray to make it easier for you to work with multidimensional data. MLShapedArray is a pure Swift type that’s similar to a normal array but supports multiple dimensions. Like array, it’s a value type, with copy-on-write semantics and a rich slicing syntax that works easily with your existing MLMultiArray code. To initialize a two-dimensional MLMultiArray, you typically use two nested “for” loops. With an MLShapedArray, you can initialize the same 2D array with a single line. MLShapedArray fits naturally in Swift and makes writing and reviewing your code that much easier. Here’s another example. To access the second row as a slice, you can just index into it like this. To access multiple rows and columns as a slice, you can use a range for each dimension. MLShapedArray and MLMultiArray are fully compatible with each other. You can easily convert one type into the other by using the initializer that takes an instance of the other type. You can also convert data types by using the converting initializer. For example, this code converts a MultiArray of doubles to a ShapedArray of Floats. Shaped arrays come in handy anytime you need to work with multidimensional data. For example, the YOLO object detection model finds objects in an image, and then it outputs a 2-dimensional array. The table shows the data from one prediction. Each row represents a bounding box, and the values in each column range between 0 and 1. Each value represents how confident the model is that the bounding box contains a person, bicycle, or car, et cetera. I want to write some code to pick the most likely label for each bounding box. Here’s an example of how to do that. The code starts with the output’s confidence property, which is a 2-dimensional MultiArray. This function loops through each row to find the highest confidence score in that row. Notice it has to frequently cast integers to NSNumber. This code uses MLShapedArray instead and does the same job in fewer lines that are easier to read. Notice the model’s prediction result gives us a ShapedArray property that contains the confidence values. This code is simpler because MLShapedArray and its scalars conform to the standard Swift collection protocols. This provides a nice strongly typed experience that’s more readable and a joy to work with in Swift. Next up, let’s talk about Core ML models and how they’re represented in the file system. Core ML makes it easy to build rich machine learning-powered experiences for your user. An ML model is the engine that brings these experiences to life. The .mlmodel file format encodes and abstracts the model’s functionality so you don’t need to worry about it. The format stores all the implementation details and complexities of a model. As a developer, you don’t need to care about whether it’s a tree ensemble or a neural network with millions of parameters. An ML Model is just a single file that you simply add to an Xcode project and write code that works with it, just like any other API. Each Core ML model file consists of several components. The metadata stores information such as the author, license, version, and a short description. The interface defines the model’s inputs and outputs. The architecture defines the model’s internal structure. For example, with a neural network, the architecture section describes the model's layers and all the connections between them. Finally, the last section stores the massive array of values that the model learned during the training phase. An ML Model file encodes all these sections into a protobuf binary format, which file systems and source control software see as a single binary file. Source control software can’t tell that the binary model file is actually a combination of several distinct components. To solve that, Core ML is adding a new model format that breaks these components into separate files, using macOS’ built-in package functionality. Which brings us to the new Core ML Model Package. It’s a container that stores each of a model’s components in its own file, separating out its architecture, weights, and metadata. By separating these components, model packages allow you to easily edit metadata and track changes with source control. They also compile more efficiently and provide more flexibility for tools which read and write models. Core ML and Xcode still fully support the original ML model format. But you can move to a more extensible format and compile more efficiently by updating to a model package. Let’s try this out in Xcode. Here’s a simple app that uses an object detection model to identify animals in an image. Notice that some of the metadata fields are empty. It’s fairly common to come across models where the metadata isn’t filled in. In the past, you couldn’t edit these fields in Xcode. But now that Xcode supports model packages, you can. Right now the model’s file type is ML Model, but when I click on the Edit button, Xcode prompts me to update the ML Model file to an ML Package. Xcode tells me that it’s about to update any of my workspace’s references to the original model file to point at the new.mlpackage. I’ll go ahead and click Update and Edit.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Ryan Chapman: Hello and welcome to WWDC. Hi, I'm Ryan Chapman, and I work on the Proactive Intelligence team. Today I'll be talking to you about how you can expand your app's presence with intent donations. Our device's operating systems have become increasingly integrated with the apps people use day to day. This collaboration between the system and apps is at the heart of an intelligent system experience that gives our users superpowers. One of the primary ways your apps can participate in this collaboration and expand your app's presence and capabilities throughout the system is by donating intents. In this session, I'll define what intent donations are, walk you through the life of an intent donation, and then talk to you about how you can structure your donations for success and ultimately expand your app's presence across the system. Let's go ahead and start out with understanding what intent donations are. Three years ago in iOS 12, we introduced Shortcuts. Shortcuts let you expose the capabilities of your app as actions. They enable people to use your app's features in new ways and places across the operating system. It's a really powerful way to engage your users and expand your presence beyond the confines of your app. Every action that you expose should be accelerative, by performing a key function of your app. That means it should take something that the user already wanted to do with your app and help them do it even faster. And next, every action that you expose should be repeatable and of persistent interest to the user. That means it should be something that the user might want to do multiple times. It's not a good idea to expose an action for something that someone might only want to do once or twice. And you should also only expose actions that are stateless and executable at any time, because you can't rely on someone being in a particular state before your action will be ready for use. To learn more about what makes a great action, be sure to check out the session called, \"Design great actions for Shortcuts, Siri, and Suggestions\" from WWDC 2021. So once you've decided what actions to expose, you're ready to check out the Shortcuts APIs. There are two APIS that you can use to adopt shortcuts for your app. The first is NSUserActivity. NSUserActivity is a lightweight way to represent the state of your app, and it integrates with other Apple features like Spotlight and Handoff. And the second is intents. Intents are a way of representing, in detail, a type of action that your app can perform, and Siri includes a bunch of great built-in intents that support a range of capabilities that you can use to integrate with the system. Intents also supports the ability for you to define your own custom intents for use with Shortcuts. To learn more about both APIs and how to adopt shortcuts for your app, be sure to watch the \"Introduction to Siri Shortcuts\" session at WWDC 2018. For this session, I'll be focusing on Intents, going over new and existing opportunities for you to offer your app's capabilities throughout the system. The first step toward making an intent donation is to decide what type of intent you'd like to adopt. Siri includes many great built-in intents, like for messaging, reservations, media, and more. There is also the ability to define custom intents in Xcode for Shortcuts. So if the action that you want to build corresponds to one of the default built-in SiriKit intents, then you should adopt that. But, otherwise, you can define your own using an intent definition file in Xcode. Once you've decided which intent you'd like to adopt and defined it in your app, you can start making intent donations. An intent donation is the act of telling the system when a person performs an action in your app. The system will store these donations and use them to expand your app's capabilities and presence throughout the system. Apps that donate intents show up in places throughout the system like Suggestions, Shortcuts, Focus, Smart Stack, and Siri. Now that you understand at a high level what an intent donation is, let's make this more concrete by going through the life of an intent donation using an example. Let's use the example of checking the weather in the Weather app. For this app, checking the weather at a particular location is the key capability of the app that I'd like to expose an action for. This app already has an existing widget that I'd like to make configurable using my intent, so someone can select the city they'd like to see the weather for in the widget. Let's go ahead and learn how to define a check weather intent, how to donate it to the system, and how the system uses the donation. The first step to defining an intent in Xcode is to create an intent definition file. To do this, I'll add a new file...",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Tao Jia: Hello, my name is Tao. Today, my colleague Jack and I are going to talk about building dynamic iOS apps with the Create ML framework. So what do I mean by an app being dynamic? Dynamic apps are those apps that give their users the flexibility to customize certain elements of the app. Dynamic apps also tailor their contents to best suit different user needs. These adaptable in-app features give your users more intelligent and personalized experiences tailored just for them. You can deliver certain such experiences by simple heuristics and predefined rules. But often times, these approaches may not render the best experience for all of your app users as their backgrounds and preferences can vary. On the other hand, machine learning techniques enable you to create models that learn directly from user data. This often is more generalizable and likely suit more users than heuristics and predefined rules. So what tools can you use to deliver such experience? The Create ML app, available on your Mac, makes it easy to create models by simply selecting some training data and hitting the train button. It supports all sorts of model types through a rich set of templates. The app is built on top of the Create ML framework which provides accelerated training of machine learning models. The Create ML Framework was originally introduced in macOS Mojave allowing for models to be trained in Swift code and from within your macOS app. And now we're bringing that framework to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. With it available on device, your apps can do all sorts of new and dynamic things. In other words, you can access programmatic APIs directly from your application for on-device model creation. It gives your app the capability to learn from and thus adapt to your users. Last but most importantly, user data never have to leave their devices; therefore, user privacy is preserved. Now, let's dive in. There are different tasks available in Create ML. Here are all the ones available on macOS, and these are now available on iOS. Among them are the popular tasks such as image, sound, and text classifiers. More recently added ones include style transfer as well as this year's new addition of hand pose and hand action classifiers. With these tools available, there are many interesting ideas and use cases. Here are a few examples. With image classification, an app can learn what a child's favorite stuffed animals look like and then help find more photos of them in order to help create a story about their adventures together. Text classifier can be used to help a user quickly organize a note they just wrote with suggested tags and folders learned from their past actions. The hand action classifier, which is new this year, could give your user the power to trigger in-app visual effects with custom hand actions. There are so many cool things you can do with Create ML on iOS but it's better to just show you what I mean with a demo. I have an app that looks a bit like a photo booth app, but more dynamic as it allows me to create a customized photo filter. Let me show you how that works. Here on my iPad, it shows at the top a list of existing filters I trained on my Mac using a Create ML style transfer task. Each one of them is represented by the particular style image used to create the filter. On the bottom, the app is waiting for a photo to try those filters, either by taking or choosing a photo. Let me take a photo now.",

    "video_transcript": "Hi, I am Sonia, a performance tools engineer. Today, my colleague Shreyas and I will show you how to diagnose power and performance regressions in your app. Every year, you work hard to release the best apps possible. You want to invite users to an amazing experience in your apps, which is why optimizing for power and performance is so important. This talk will cover key metrics that affect your app's performance, tools to help you discover regressions, insights to help you reduce disk writes, and APIs to automate your performance workflows. To help you optimize performance, there's a comprehensive set of metrics and diagnostics available to you through the Xcode Organizer and App Store Connect API, without any changes to your app. As you know, performance is not easy to optimize. With so many metrics and diagnostics available, it can be easy to get lost in a sea of information. You want to make each release better than the last, but need a quick way to summarize your performance priorities. The Xcode Organizer is a great tool to understand performance. It currently collects data across seven metric categories, including battery, launches, hangs, memory, disk writes, scroll hitches, and terminations. That's a lot of information to process. Let's dive into the Xcode Organizer next and diagnose a performance regression. I'll start by viewing different metrics for my app. I can choose from seven metric categories on the left navigation bar. Some categories, like battery and terminations, can have multiple sections, as well as subcategories detailing different event types. I can optionally choose between dozens of different device types, as well as percentiles for top and typical users of my app. The center of the organizer shows a chart with data for the last 16 releases. In this case, I want to investigate terminations in my app.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Erik Hornberger: Welcome back to the research and care app code-along! This is part two of our three-part series where you and I will build out a physical therapy app for our friend Jamie. If you'd like to follow along, you can find our project in the session resources. I'll just go ahead and get logged in here. If you joined us for session one, you'll recall that we just finished onboarding and consent. In this session -- Oh, hang on. It looks like we've got a message from Jamie. \"Got some new ideas for the app.\" \"Did you see my last text?\" Additional app requirements. Jamie has invited you to collaborate on a Notes document. OK, well, let's just see what we're going to be doing this time! Displaying forms, persisting some data, dynamic schedules, range of motion. OK. So it looks like Jamie wants us to set up a daily check-in survey where we ask the participants about how much sleep they got and how much pain they're experiencing. We'll show you how to use ResearchKit's form items to put multiple questions on a single page. Then, we'll need to parse the results from the ResearchKit survey and persist them into CareKit. That'll cause our completion rings to fill up and our task card UI to update. We'll also go into detail on how to create more advanced schedules with CareKit, and then we'll use one of those schedules -- along with ResearchKit -- to prompt participants to measure the range of motion in their knees. We've got a lot to cover here, so let's jump in! We'll get started with the daily check-in survey. Just like we did for our onboarding task, we'll begin by defining a schedule and a CareKit task. It's supposed to be a daily check-in, so let's just schedule it to happen each morning at, say, 8:00 am. We'll create the check-in task with a unique identifier and the schedule we just defined. And of course, we'll need to persist it here in our store. This is all exactly the same as what we did for the onboarding task. Hopefully it's starting to feel familiar to you! And just like the onboarding task, our next step will be to jump over to CareFeedViewController and tell CareKit how to display this task. This time around, let's make our solution a bit more generic. We'll fetch all the tasks for the current date. Then for each task, we'll create a view controller, and append that view controller into our list. This should scale a bit more nicely as we add more tasks. Now, we haven't actually defined this fetchTasks method or this viewController method. We'll need to drop down a bit further in our file and write them out. So here's our fetchTasks method. We start by creating a task query for a specific date, and we specify that we want to exclude tasks that don't have any scheduled events. This comes into play when we have tasks that don't happen every day. Let's say, for example, you've been given a prescription to take a medication every Monday. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, that prescription is still assigned to you, there just aren't any pills to take. This property ensures that such tasks are not returned from the query. Once the query comes back, we'll pass the tasks we fetched to our completion handler. We'll also need to fill out a method that takes a task and returns a view controller. We'll inspect the id of the task, and if it's the checkIn task, we'll use the new SurveyTaskViewController we introduced in part one. Just like before, we'll supply a task, an eventQuery, and a reference to the storeManager. We'll also need to pass in a ResearchKit survey and a function for converting the ResearchKit result into an array of CareKit outcome values. We'll write these two methods in just a moment, but first let's take a look at how our app, ResearchKit, and CareKit are going to work together. Our app will create a ResearchKit survey. ResearchKit will take over and guide the participant through the survey flow. It will produce an ORKTaskResult, which it will hand back to our app. Then our app will convert the ResearchKit result into CareKit outcome values to be persisted in CareKit's store. Saving a new outcome will cause our completion rings to fill up and our task cards' UIs to update. All right, so let's tackle these two methods. We'll define them over in Surveys.swift. I've prepared a couple of identifiers that we'll be using down below. We need one method for creating a ResearchKit survey and one for converting the result into CareKit outcome values. We want to discover if there is a link between the amount of sleep a participant gets and how much pain they experience, so we'll create a form with two questions. The formStep requires a unique identifier, a title, and some text. We'll also mark it nonoptional, since we don't want the form to be skippable. Next, let's create our two items. The first will inquire about pain, and we'll make it a nonoptional question. What that means is that the form itself cannot be skipped, nor can we submit the form without an answer to this particular question. You can see that we also need to provide an answer format. The answer format tells ResearchKit what kind of answer to expect and how to prompt the user to enter it. Are they entering a weight, are they selecting an image, or are they recording their voice? In this case, we'll opt to use the ORKScaleAnswerFormat, which creates a UISlider. Sliders are a familiar interface to iOS users; they're intuitive, and they provide a much nicer experience than filling in circles on a paper survey. We'll specify a maximum pain score of 10, a minimum value of 1, set the step size to 1 so that only round numbers are allowed, and provide descriptions of the min and the max values. All right, let's drop down a little further and create one more item: a sleepItem. This is almost exactly the same as the painItem, and we'll use a nearly identical answer format as well. The only difference is the identifier, and that we've changed the min to 0 hours of sleep and the max to 12 hours of sleep. Now we just need to pass these two items into our form item, then create an ORKOrderedTask with a single formStep. The second function is supposed to take a ResearchKit task result and create an array of CareKit values to persist. But before we write this code, let's take a look at the structure of a ResearchKit task result so that we have a better idea of how to parse it. It's important to understand that ORKTaskResults are nested types. We want to start at the root result for the check-in survey and then drill down to the checkin.form. The checkin.form has two children itself, and we'll need to dig down to each of them. First, we want to find the answers given for the pain item identifier and then for the sleep item identifier. We know those are both scale question results, and we can get the scale answers off of them. In this example, 4 and 11. So that's what it looks like visually, and this is what the same process looks like in code. Starting at the root result, we find the first child that is marked with the form identifier. That result will have its own children, and we can extract all of the children with the type ORKScaleQuestionResult, of which we know there will be two. The pain answer is the first one marked with the pain identifier, and the sleep answer is the first one marked with the sleep identifier. Both will have scaleAnswer properties. Once we have the answers in hand, we need to convert them into a CareKit outcome value -- one for sleep and one for pain. The kind property here is optional. You don't need to set it, but it can be helpful if you want to look up a value later. We'll see why this is useful in part three! The last thing that we need to do is return our two values from this function. With all that in place, our daily check-in should be good to go! Let's run the app and see how we're doing. Note that we have already completed onboarding in part one, so we don't need to go through the consent flow again. This is the true content of our app, and the CareKit check-in task we've just created is right where we expect it to be. Tapping on the card takes us into the ResearchKit survey. We'll just go ahead and give some answers here. Let's go with, like, say, a 4 for pain and we'll go with 8 hours of sleep. When we get back to our Care Feed, we can see that the completion ring at the top fills up, indicating that the answers from ResearchKit were successfully parsed into CareKit. This is looking really good. So we've finished our check-in survey with its multiquestion form, and we've verified that data is persisted into CareKit the way that we want it to be. That means we're about halfway there! It's time to move on to advanced schedules in CareKit, which we'll later apply to our range of motion task. Like the check-in task and the onboarding task before it, the first step is to define a schedule. But we're going to do something a bit more involved for this one. Jamie has asked that we reduce how often we ask participants to measure their range of motion as time goes on. Specifically, we want to set up a schedule that prompts the participant to measure their range of motion every day for the first week, but then, only once a week until the end of the month, and then never again after that. So once a day for the first week, then once a week for the rest of the month. Let's begin by defining a few key dates: thisMorning, nextWeek, and nextMonth. Now, if you want to create more nuanced schedules in CareKit, OCKScheduleElement is the tool for the job. Schedule elements have a start date, an end date, and repeat at some interval during that period. The dailyElement here starts this morning, ends next week, and repeats every day. The second element is the weeklyElement. It starts next week, ends next month, and repeats every week. Now that we have our two elements, we can compose them together to create a compound schedule, and then we can create a new range of motion task using that schedule. Of course, we'll need to add it into our store as well. Just like our other tasks, the next step is to hop back into our CareFeed and specify how we want CareKit to display this task. Once again, we'll use the SurveyTaskViewController, and we'll need to supply a survey, as well as functions, to extract the answers. Let's jump back into Surveys.swift and stub those out to provide a bit of structure before we get started. OK, so the range of motion task is actually pretty simple. As a matter of fact, it's built into ResearchKit as a predefined task. We just need to give it an identifier and specify which knee is to be measured. Now the predefined task has a completion step built into it, and the message it shows is a reasonable default, but we'd really like to show a custom message tailored to our use case. So we're going to tell ResearchKit to omit the standard completion step. Then, we'll define our own and give it an encouraging message specifically related to physical therapy. So that's the first function. The second one is where we'll convert from a ResearchKit result to CareKit outcome values. Hopefully this is starting to feel familiar now. There are a lot of ways we can go about this, but today we're going to dig down until we get to the first range of motion result. And we know there will only be one. Range of motion results actually have a bunch of useful properties on them, but the one we're most interested in for our use case is range, which measures how far the participant was able to bend their knee in degrees. We can use the kind field along with key paths to make it easy to look up this value later. That's foreshadowing for part three, by the way. All right, and that wraps up our function for extracting the outcome values. Nice! I think we're all set up. Let's run our app and I'll show you how it all works. The first thing that we want to check is that our schedule is working the way that we intend it to. The Range Of Motion task should show up every day during the first week. As I page through the 8th, and the 9th, and the 10th, the range of motion task shows up every day. But when I get out to next week, it stops showing up except on Monday here, which is the one day of the week that we still want it to appear. Here it's still showing up only once per week. But if we go out even further into the future, all the way to next month, it doesn't show up at all anymore. CareKit schedules are a great way to preprogram regimens like this. Let's jump back to today and try this out.",

After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan's co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today's world to become 10% happier.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ My name is Dan Harris. I'm a longtime --that's my way of saying I'm old-- longtime correspondent and anchorman with \"ABC News.\" I've worked at \"ABC News\" for 21 years. And then about seven years ago, I wrote a book called \"Ten Percent Happier,\" which was about how a skeptical journalist came to embrace meditation. For me, the whole thing started with a panic attack, a very public panic attack on \"Good Morning America.\" Even more embarrassing than having a panic attack on national television was what caused the panic attack. I think at the root of that meltdown was something that everybody who is part of this conference has, which is ambition. I arrived at \"ABC News\" at the big leagues, the network, at the tender age of 28 years old, and I was really anxious about being so young and being so inexperienced, and I just threw myself into my work in a really, really sort of workaholic-style way. And shortly after I arrived at \"ABC News,\" there was a huge event in the news, and that was 9/11. And I kind of raised my hand after 9/11 to volunteer to go overseas to cover whatever was gonna happen next, and I spent many years in war zones like Afghanistan and Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, a lot of time in Iraq… six or seven long stays in Iraq. And I came home in the middle of this period, and I got depressed, although I didn't actually know I was depressed, and I did something extremely stupid at this point, which is I started to self-medicate with recreational drugs. And even though my drug use, primarily cocaine, was pretty limited and I was never high on the air, after I went to-- after the panic attack, I went to go see a doctor, and he asked me a bunch of questions. And one of the questions was, \"Do you do drugs?\" And I kind of sheepishly said, \"Yeah, I do.\" And he gave me a look that indicated, \"OK, moron. Mystery solved.\" And he pointed out that even though the drug use was somewhat unspectacular, it was enough to change my brain chemistry and make it more likely for me to freak out. So this was a huge ‘Aha!’ moment for me, and I decided to quit doing drugs and to go see this shrink once or twice a week indefinitely. I started to poke around and realized that there was a lot of evidence that suggested that meditation was really good for you, that it could lower your blood pressure, boost your immune system, literally rewire key parts of your brain. And there was at this time a not very well-publicized body of research that strongly suggested that meditation was really good for you, so I started to try it, and I started with, like, five or ten minutes a day. And I found that there were really three main benefits.",

First, our new Swift Overlay for Accelerate. And second, measuring Accelerate's performance using the Linpack benchmark. Before we dive into the Swift Overlay, let's recap exactly what the Accelerate framework is. The primary purpose of Accelerate is to provide thousands of low-level math primitives that run on a CPU and support image and signal processing, vector arithmetic, linear algebra, and machine learning. Most of these primitives are hand tuned to the microarchitecture of the processor. This means we get excellent performance and this performance translates directly into energy savings. So, if you're an app developer and you use the Accelerate framework, not only will your application run faster, but you'll also use less battery life.",

Finally, I will describe the ways in which you can customize the analyzer to better integrate it with your development workflow. Let's now see how to use the analyzer to find bugs. The static analyzer is a tool in Xcode that can discover bugs by analyzing the source code without running it, so it can reveal bugs, even before you do testing and quality assurance of your app. It can also find problems in code paths that are rare and not covered by tests. The analyzer finds bugs in C/C++ and Objective-C code, even in mixed Swift and Objective-C projects. Let us see the analyzer in action using an app I am developing. I am trying to improve an existing app written in Swift and Objective-C that allows exploring the solar system. This is the Xcode project for the app. I am going to run the Static Analyzer to see if it finds anything wrong with my code. It's very easy to run.

    "video_resources-href": "",
    "video_transcript": "Hello, and welcome to WWDC. My name is Joel, and I would like to tell you about how you can add music to your apps with MusicKit. MusicKit is a new framework for Apple platforms which offers expressive APIs for your apps to access music items in Swift. It leverages the new Swift concurrency syntax and is designed from the ground up to be used in conjunction with SwiftUI. MusicKit accelerates the way your apps integrate with Apple Music API, which are our set of server-side APIs for accessing the wide array of catalog content from Apple Music, thus making it much easier for you to build compelling apps that tie into Apple Music. First, we'll talk about how to request music content with MusicKit. Next, we'll talk about other topics that are important for the way your apps integrate with Apple Music, such as requesting consent from the user for your app to access Apple Music-related data, managing tokens required for accessing Apple Music API, accessing subscription information and related capabilities, playing music from the Apple Music catalog, and finally, how to show subscription offers for Apple Music, in case your user isn't already a subscriber. MusicKit offers a new model layer for accessing music items, with structured requests that allow you to fetch content from Apple Music API. You can either search for content in the Apple Music catalog, or fetch resources based on a specific filter. These requests produce responses with items grouped in collections, which have built-in support for pagination, allowing you to get the next batch of items from an initial response. So, what do these music items look like? Let's take a look at a specific example with an album. \"Album\" is a value type with properties grouped in three different categories. The first category contains simple attributes, such as a string property like \"title,\" a boolean property like \"isCompilation,\" or more structured properties like \"artwork,\" which gives you access to URLs for the artwork alongside relevant sizing information and related colors. Album also offers several relationships, such as related artists or genres, or the list of tracks in a given album. For example, the result of the \"tracks\" relationship is a collection of values of type \"Track,\" which is another type of music item. Finally, in addition to these strong model-level relationships, \"Album\" offers several weaker associations of related content. Associations are very similar to relationships, but they are typically more ephemeral, or more editorially driven. For example, the \"appearsOn\" association on an album returns a collection of playlists, but, unlike collections for relationships, this one also has a title. Loading and accessing relationships with MusicKit is very simple. Given an album, you can easily fetch another representation of this same album that includes relationships like \"artists\" and \"tracks,\" as well as associations like \"related albums,\" in a single operation. The \"with\" method needs to be called with the special Swift keyword \"await,\" which indicates that this will perform an asynchronous operation behind the scenes. This will indeed fetch a more complete representation of this album from Apple Music API over the network. You can then get the list of tracks from this detailed album, and iterate over those tracks as you would with a regular array. And here's the console output for this code. Accessing associations such as \"related albums\" works the same way, with the only difference being that they typically also include a title, accessible directly on the collection. You can then iterate over the collection in that same manner to print a few of those related albums. And here's the console output for this code. Now, let's take a look at a demo of requesting music content with MusicKit. I've been working on an app which allows me to find and enjoy albums from Apple Music. I can search for albums using this search field, which is already connected some code to load matching search results using the music catalog search request. This app also keeps track of the list of albums I recently viewed. We can find more information about this album titled \"Catch A Vibe - EP\" by selecting it, and you may have noticed the list of tracks for this album being animated in after this detail view appeared. This is done by loading the \"tracks\" relationship of this album as we just saw, and updating the state variable for our SwiftUI view, which is then used to populate this list. We can begin playing music from this album with the play button underneath the artwork, or by selecting a specific track. This will simply use the playback API in MusicKit to set the queue with this list of tracks, and call the play method on the player. Let's try it out! So, if I select the track titled \"Catch a Vibe\" by Karun & MONBRU...  This song begins playing. ♪ Ooh, oh, no ♪ Our app even works automatically in media controls in the Lock screen, which allows me to scrub to a halfway point in this song.  But I was hoping to use this app to help me rediscover old music from my CD library, like this album from Phoenix. So, I'd like to add a feature that would allow me to point the camera of my iPhone to the barcode of an old CD and have this app surface this same album in digital format. I've already added some experimental code for this feature. When I enable it, I can see a barcode button at the bottom, which brings up a camera view. If I point it to the barcode of this CD, it automatically recognizes the barcode value and displays it. All I'm missing is some code that uses MusicKit to find the corresponding album. Let's go ahead and add that to our app. So let me make an albumsRequest using the MusicCatalogResourceRequest. I am looking specifically for albums.",

Your apps and your creativity have enabled people to find new ways to keep things moving under extraordinary circumstances. There are so many great examples of developers making a difference, and we know there's much more we can do to help you make the world better faster. So this year we're delivering tools, technologies, and APIs designed to help you accomplish more. And we'll be talking today about three big areas where we're making that happen. First, we'll talk about the things that help you build great apps: Xcode and Xcode Cloud, Swift, and our UI frameworks. Then we'll look at how Apple technologies can help you build apps that make it possible with augmented reality and our graphics technologies for users to see the world in new ways. Finally, with new features like Focus, the Screen Time API, Widgets, and Share Play, we'll see ways in which the apps you build can help users better connect with each other and prioritize what's most important to them. Let's start with developing apps. To tell you more, here are Alison, Rhonda, and Andrew.",

    "video_transcript": "Hi, I'm Harrison from the Game Center team. Thanks for joining me to learn about using recurring leaderboards in your games. Game Center provides a convenient identity players can use to access their data across many of their games. As a developer, Game Center allows you to easily add features like achievements, multiplayer, and leaderboards, which is what I'm here to talk about today. As this is a code-along, you'll need to do some initial setup in order to participate. Then, I'll give a quick recap of Game Center's leaderboard types and walk through the provided sample game. Finally, I'll add a recurring leaderboard in App Store Connect, and show a couple different ways to use it in the sample game. Let's start with some setup. We've provided a project compatible with Xcode 13 in the developer portal to get you started. I encourage you to pause the video and download that now. After it's downloaded, resume, and I'll walk you through some initial setup. In the folder you downloaded, you'll find an Xcode project called The Coast. Go ahead and open that now. Since you're going to modify this app to use Game Center features, it needs to be registered with your team. Follow along, pausing as needed. First, select TheCoast project file from the project navigator. Then, select TheCoast from the list of Targets. In the Signing & Capabilities pane, choose your team from the Team menu. If your Apple ID or team isn't in the menu, first choose Add an Account and enter your Apple ID information. Next, set the bundle ID to a unique identifier. You must change the bundle ID to proceed. If prompted, click Register Device to create a provisioning profile. Once you've successfully registered, there won't be any warnings listed under the status. Now that your chosen bundle ID is registered, you can add an app record to App Store Connect. In the top right corner of App Store Connect, select the team you used when registering your bundle ID. Then, navigate to the My Apps section. Click the plus button in the top left corner, and select New App. You'll be working on an iOS-only app, so select iOS as the platform. Pick an appropriate name, primary language, and SKU. For bundle ID, make sure you choose the bundle ID you registered in Xcode. After all the required fields are filled out, select Create to add your app record. You'll be coming back to App Store Connect a little later. But now, I'm going to give a quick recap of leaderboards. All of our leaderboards let players see how well they rank against friends and players around the world. Our leaderboard types primarily differ by how long the leaderboard is active. Classic leaderboards are always active, with no ending. They maintain an all-time ranking, as well as rolling weekly and daily rankings. They're particularly useful for cumulative scores, like total experience points earned or current number of coins. Recurring leaderboards, on the other hand, are short-lived leaderboards that repeat on a developer-defined schedule, like every 5 minutes or every 30 days. You can retrieve a currently active leaderboard occurrence, and you can also retrieve the most recently finished occurrence that a player has submitted to, for up to 30 days after its end time. Recurring leaderboards are useful for periodic, timed events, like a 1-hour challenge every Sunday at noon, or a new leaderboard every week. I'm going to highlight a specific use case for recurring leaderboards during the session. But first, let's go back to the project you opened in Xcode. Build and run it on an iOS device or a simulator.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Edward: Hi, and welcome to WWDC! I'm Edward, an engineer on the Wallet team, and later I'll be joined by my colleague, Russ. We're very excited to be here today to talk to you about what's new in Wallet and Apple Pay. Today I'd like to talk about three main areas. First, I'd like to share some Wallet updates and tell you about some exciting rollouts we've had in the last year. Second, we have made a lot of exciting updates to Apple Pay. We've also added some new functionality, making payments even easier to use. Third, I want to go through some new API enhancements that we've made. So let's get started with some updates to Wallet. As you may have heard in the Keynote, we're bringing identity cards to Apple Wallet. Starting in the US, with a few select states, you can just scan your driver's license or state ID and capture a selfie. Your ID is protected by the Secure Element. The TSA is working to enable airport security checkpoints as the first place you can use your digital ID. For more information on this, check out the links associated with this session. Also new in iOS 15, we've added support for HomeKit-connected locks, so users can now tap to unlock a door with a home key pass. When it comes to adding passes, we know many of your users install them right from the web. In iOS 14, if you wanted to add four movie tickets, for example, you would add them individually. New this year, we've added multipass downloads from Safari. With a straightforward change, you can bundle passes together, making the experience smooth for your users. To do this, you'll need to do three things. First, zip the PkPass files together. Second, set the file extension to .pkpasses. And, finally, use the correct mime type. Now, all the passes in the bundle will be downloaded and processed by Wallet in a single download. And with all these passes, it can sometimes be troublesome for you to keep track of them all. We also know that many people don't like to delete old passes, preferring instead to have them as keepsakes, but that can make Wallet kind of cluttered. So new in iOS 15, Wallet will now automatically hide your expired passes, keeping passes organized and easy to find. Let me show you an example of how you can take advantage of this. Here we see some JSON from an example pass. Wallet looks at three fields to determine if a pass should be automatically hidden. Number one, the pass has an expiration date that is older than the current date. Two, the relevant date is older than one day. Or three, the pass has been voided. To ensure a great experience for your users, you should ensure these fields are set correctly on your passes. Now let me tell you about some updates we've made to Apple Pay. Apple Pay continues to be the easiest way to make payments on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. It allows users to make payments in apps and on the web. Apple Pay is supported in iMessage and Business Chat, and also in App Clips for streamlined, in-the-moment experiences. Apple Pay usage around the world continues to grow. We've added support in Mexico, Israel, and South Africa this year, meaning Apple Pay is now available in 55 countries and regions across the globe. We've added support for Express Transit in more locations. And, we've included support for combined credit and debit cards in places such as Brazil. Now, I'd like to show you a few changes that you can make to your apps and websites to create a great payment experience. Last year we added support for more button types such as Rent with Apple Pay and Top Up with Apple Pay. Today we're introducing one more: Continue with Apple Pay. You should use this button when offering Apple Pay in a cart alongside other buttons. You can use Continue as a call to action. We're also introducing a new JavaScript implementation for the Apple Pay button. This new button supports all current button types and styles. It's easy to implement, and can be customized to match the design of your sites. Here is an example implementation. As you can see, the button size and style can be configured easily. Note that the styles are prefixed with \"apple-pay\". For more information on this, check out the documentation on the Apple Developer Portal. Next, I'd like to show you the big changes we've made to Apple Pay for iPhone and iPad. For iOS 15, we're excited to make payments even better with a brand-new Apple Pay experience. We rebuilt the Apple Pay sheet from the ground up in SwiftUI with an all-new design. It gives users an even clearer and smoother payment experience with a great new look. We also implemented several new features to improve conversion. For users new to Apple Pay, we simplified the flow to add a card and addresses from the payment sheet. Existing users will be able to add another card without leaving the Apple Pay experience. We also redesigned the error handling for more clarity when a problem does occur. Once a user has finished adding a new payment method, they seamlessly resume their transaction. We also added a new summary view which shows more detailed information, such as payment items, discounts, and subtotals. New for iOS 15, we also display your app's icon on the summary view. For payments on the web, we're now showing the Web Clip icon on the payment summary view. In Apple Pay, this was previously only visible when using handoff from a Mac to complete a transaction. Now your website icon is viewable within the Apple Pay transaction to provide visual reassurance for the user that payment is going to the right place. If you accept Apple Pay on the web and you haven't already set a Web Clip icon, we would strongly recommend you make your icon visible to users. To do this, you should provide a 2x and 3x icon at the sizes shown in your root document folder. Apple Pay will then automatically retrieve and display this icon with the payment request. Detailed information on implementing this is available in the Human Interface Guidelines section of the Apple Developer site. While we're on the subject of icon sizes, I wanted to remind you of the new icon size requirements for your PKPasses. Since notifications in iOS 15 now display a bigger icon, you'll need to update your PKPass icons to a minimum of 38x38 at 1x to ensure that your icons are displayed without blurring. We're also pleased to introduce more flexibility in the total line. This will enable you to add a date if the payment occurs later; for example, if you take pre-orders or to add the frequency for a recurring payment. Many of the new features we've just observed can be added to your apps with only a few straightforward changes. So we'll now take a closer look into the API enhancements we're introducing in iOS 15. We're pleased to add support for shipping date ranges. Now you can present your users with relevant shipping or pickup times within Apple Pay. These can be used to set estimated shipping or delivery dates or time windows for in-store pickups. This extra information is displayed right on the main Apple Pay view. The new shipping date APIs have built-in support for calendars and time zones. This makes the handling of shipping dates or pick up times in your app straightforward and the relevant information is displayed clearly to your users. Now I'll briefly show you how this works. We start by defining a normal shipping method using the same PKShippingMethod as before. Next, we choose a calendar. In this example, we use the user's current calendar. We use today as a reference and estimate the arrival between three to seven days from this date. We then determine the start and end date for our date range using the calendar. Finally, we convert the dates to the appropriate date components and then we add them to the shipping method. We use date components rather than simple dates so we can take advantage of the rich calendar and time zone support built into iOS. This enables use cases that would otherwise not be possible. For example, we can provide the correct time zone for a pickup time regardless of the user's current time zone. This level of detail also allows us to show the date and time information most appropriate to the user, such as displaying a specific pickup time. We've included a JavaScript equivalent for Apple Pay on the web. You can see we specify the date component range a little differently than we do in Swift. Your date components can be used in conjunction with any of our supported pickup types. For example, you could display a pickup time in your app. In addition to date ranges, you can now declare a read-only shipping address. You can use this to inform the user of a specific pickup location. To enable this, you must provide address details as an instance of PKContact. In this example, we have created a postal address as a CNMutablePostalAddress so we can set all the address components that we need. You can now add the shipping contact to payment request. Finally we declare the editing mode and specify the required shipping fields. The address fields included in the PKContact will be presented to the user as read-only. In this example, we've provided a pick up postal address, which the user won't be able to edit. And here's the equivalent in JavaScript for Apple Pay on the web. You setup a shippingContact dictionary, set the shippingType, the shippingContactEditingMode, and the requiredShippingContactFields, and then you include the other fields for a JavaScript payment request. For more information, check out the documentation available on the Apple Pay section of the Developer Portal. Another great new feature for iOS 15 is support for coupon codes. Now your users can enter promotional codes once they've initiated a payment. This is intended so your users don't have to cancel their Apple Pay transaction if they forgot to apply a discount code. You might also consider implementing this if you have an express purchase flow where users can check out from the product page or the shopping cart, but the coupon entry field is only presented at checkout. We've provided methods to update the payment request, so you can validate the discount codes or return error messages when required. Let's dive in and take a look at the code. You can make changes using the delegate method which performs updates whenever the coupon code is changed by the user. For example, you could use this to validate a code and then update any payment totals. You also use the method to return customized errors or update the payment summary items and shipping methods. Russ will show you an example of this in more detail shortly. We recommend prepopulating codes whenever possible, as well as displaying relevant error messages for invalid codes. I hope you've enjoyed these exciting API enhancements for iOS 15. Now that we have talked all about this in theory, I'm going to hand you over to Russ for a demo so you can see how to implement all these great new features. Russ Fenenga: Thanks, Edward. Hello, everyone. My name is Russ, and I'm a software engineer on the Wallet team. And I'm thrilled to be able to demonstrate to you some of the amazing new features we have added to the payment sheet in iOS 15 and how you can integrate them into your apps. So let's get started! Here I have my ticket purchasing app for the food festival I'm planning. My app has already implemented the existing protocol methods from PKPaymentAuthorization ControllerDelegate in order to take advantage of the Apple Pay payment sheet. With iOS 15, the payment sheet will automatically be updated to the new look without any additional work. I've decided that with the update to iOS 15 I want my festival attendees to finally have the ability to request their tickets in multiple ways. To do this, I'll need to add support for multiple shipping methods, so let's dive in! I'll head into our PaymentHandler class where I build the PKPaymentRequest to begin adding support for multiple PKShippingMethods. The first thing I'm going to add is a helper function that returns me an array of PKShippingMethods representing the different options available to my users. The first PKShippingMethod I create is a standard shipping method, letting the user know they can collect their tickets at the festival. New to iOS 15, I want to provide the user an estimated range it will take the tickets to be shipped to them. To do this I create a Date and Calendar object, then define a shippingStart and shippingEnd date three to five days from now. I'm then able to specify the date components that I want to display to the user in the payment sheet. Then I build my PKShippingMethod making sure I set the new property, dateComponentsRange, and return the array of the two shipping methods. The last thing I need to do is set the shipping methods on the PKPaymentRequest like so.",

You can also view computed styles and modify style rules in the Styles section of the sidebar. Rules that have media queries are shown with media query information. Default TVMLKit styles are shown as the User Agent Stylesheet and are locked. These styles cannot be modified. In the Network tab, you can see all the resources loaded by the current app. In addition to the default tab features, there is a button to clear network items. You can also inspect timing information, examine Request & Response headers, and see the response result. Next is the Resources tab. If you include structured comments in your app's JavaScript files, those files will show up in Resources for further examination. The Timelines tab helps you check the performance of your app. Here we have a prerecorded example in the Timelines tab.

In this year’s releases, we have some of the biggest advancements ever in this API. We started at a low level, rethinking what an attributed string is in Swift. We rebuilt our formatters for Swift, making them faster, easier to use, and adding new features. And finally, we have a brand new feature called automatic grammar agreement. It dramatically reduces the number of localized strings you need to provide while, at the same time, making your code simpler. Let’s jump right in to attributed strings. An attributed string is a combination of characters, a set of ranges, and a dictionary. Attributed strings allow you to associate attributes, which are key-value pairs, to a specific range of a string. The most common attributes are defined by the SDK, but you can also create your own. You’ll often find attributed strings in API that supports rich text. Let’s look at an example. Here is an app I’m working on called Caffé. It’s a simple menu. I pick the food that I want, the size, the quantity. And at the end, it shows me a receipt with a list of everything I’ve ordered. At the bottom here, I decided to add a short thank-you note. This is an attributed string. Part of the string is in bold and part is in italics. The last word has a link as well. As you can tell here, attributes can overlap. Since the beginning of Foundation, we’ve had a reference type called NSAttributedString. This year, we introduce a new struct AttributedString, which takes full advantage of all of the features that Swift provides us. First and foremost, it’s a value type. It also has the same character-counting behavior as Swift String. As part of our commitment to making it easy to write inclusive software, AttributedString is now fully localizable. Finally, it is built with safety and security in mind. This includes both compile time safety by using strong typing and also safety during unarchiving using Codable. Let’s take a brief tour of what you can do with the new AttributedString. We’re going to build our thank-you message. First, we create an attributed string using a simple initializer. I want to set an attribute on this entire string. That’s as simple as setting the font property. In struct AttributedString, all attributes are available directly, and they use the correct types. This property, for example, is a SwiftUI Font. Next, we create another attributed string. This one is a reference to our website, so we set the link property to a URL. Here I’m setting the font and link on the whole string. We’ll look at how to change just part of a string later. Another useful tool is an attribute container. It’s a place you can hold attributes and values on their own without the string. Here, I create a container and set some attributes on it, depending on the importance of my message. And finally, I merge those attributes into both attributed strings. As I mentioned, attributed string is a combination of characters, ranges, and a dictionary. The attributed string itself is not a collection of any single one of those things. Instead, in order to gain access to these properties, it has what we call views. The two most important views are characters, which provides access to the string, and runs, which provides access to the attributes. These views are Swift collections, which means the functions you are familiar with from types like Array are available here too. Let’s look at another example. Let’s say our designers told us to add a little bit of pizzazz to our thank-you message by making all punctuation a fun orange color. To do this, first I need to find where the punctuation is in the attributed string. Like other Swift collections, attributed string views use indices, which are simply a position for some element in the collection. To iterate by index, I use the standard library indices function. Next, I use the function isPunctuation to check if this character is one that we need to change. Finally, I use another feature of attributed string, slicing, to apply an attribute to only a subrange of the whole string. The range starts at this index and continues until the next index after that, so one character. And now the punctuation is orange. Let’s look at another view, runs. A run is the starting location, length, and value of a particular attribute. We can start by counting all the runs in our message. This will iterate each contiguous range of attribute values in the string. There are four runs in this string. Each run has a value or nil for each attribute. The ranges from characters and runs are interchangeable, so you can find the string for an attribute or vice-versa. Here I use the range of the attribute in a subscript for the characters view, converting the result into a standalone string. It’s often most useful to look at runs by focusing on a specific attribute. Here, we use the key path link to coalesce for just the link attribute. Each element of the resulting collection will give us the value of the link attribute, not taking into account other attributes which may be set in the string. If we only look at links, we have three runs: the first, where it is not set; the second, where it is set to a value; and the third, the last period in the sentence, where it is not set again. Iterating the runs gives us a tuple of the value and the range. Since the values are type safe, we can use an API, like scheme, which exists on URL, without casting or worrying about having the wrong type. Here I’m checking that every link in the attributed string is https. Another useful technique is to look for a substring and use that range to edit the characters or the attributes. Let’s say I want to replace the word \"visit' with something that has a more throwback vibe. First, I look for the range of a substring. Next, I use that range to set the attributes and characters on only that subrange. The result is an attributed string with six runs, like this. Next, let’s talk about localization. AttributedString is fully localizable. We also added localization support to NSAttributedString in Objective-C. Attributed strings are located in your app’s strings files, just like a regular string. In Swift, we now support localized formatting of String and AttributedString using string interpolation just like SwiftUI’s text view. Here’s a simple example. This function returns a localized string which is customized with a user’s document name. Instead of using format specifiers like %@ or %d and calling a format function, you can now just pass the value in directly. The same approach works for AttributedString. Xcode can generate your strings files from these new initializers using the compiler. To turn it on, go to your build settings, look for the localization settings, and turn on Use Compiler to Extract Swift Strings. You may be wondering how the localized attributed string gets its attributes. I’m excited to tell you that we’ve added support for Markdown to AttributedString. Here’s an example of using a localized attributed string, right in a SwiftUI Text. I start off with just a plain string. By adding two asterisks around the text, I make it strongly emphasized, which SwiftUI renders as bold. I can use underscores to make the text emphasized, which SwiftUI renders as italic. We also support links. This is a great opportunity for localizers to provide customized URLs for different languages. We also support other inline styles like strikethrough and code voice. Finally, let’s talk about archiving attributed strings. First, we need the ability to convert to and from the NSAttributedString reference type. Attributed strings can be part of your data model, which means we need to be able to encode and decode them. Finally, we want a way to specify custom attributes in Markdown. These operations are all related to each other. Let’s start by looking at conversion. We’ve all written a lot of code that uses NSAttributedString, so we’ve made it easy to convert from the struct to the class type. Here’s a view that has an NSAttributedString property. To convert, just pass our struct AttributedString to the NSAttributedString initializer. For attributes that are part of the SDK, this is all I need to do. Now let’s look at encoding and decoding. Here is a struct that holds a receipt from our Caffé app. Again, I’m using the attributes provided by SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit, and Foundation. That means that AttributedString’s default Codable implementation is all I need. I just add the Codable conformance to Receipt, and I’m done. Let’s go a bit further and add support for encoding a custom attribute. We’ll start by talking about the attribute itself. An attribute is two parts: a key and a value. The key is a type which conforms with the new AttributedStringKey protocol. That defines what type of value it requires and a name for archiving. This key can also conform with other protocols to customize how the value is encoded or decoded. Let’s say we want to define a range of an attributed string to have some extra color. This rainbow effect comes in three levels: plain, fun, or extreme. We’ll use an enum to represent that value and set the name to rainbow. Defining the type and the name are the only requirements of this protocol. Now, let’s say we want to make this attribute Codable so that it will be part of the encoded attributed string. All I have to do is add Codable conformance, like this. Finally, let’s say we want the rainbow level to be part of our localized string. That means it can be applied to the right part of the string, no matter where that is, in any language. All we need is one more protocol conformance to opt in. When we say that an attribute is Markdown decodable, then we can decode it straight from Markdown and insert it into an attributed string. All that’s required is that the value is Codable. Next, let’s take a look at the custom attribute syntax for Markdown. In this first example, we have a reference to a link. It uses square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the link destination, a URL. In this second example, we have a reference to an image. It starts with an exclamation point, then uses square brackets for the image description and parentheses for the image source. These first two examples are common in Markdown. The third example shows our syntax for custom attributes. It starts with a caret, then uses square brackets for the text, and parentheses for its attributes. The attributes are represented with JSON 5. JSON 5 is compatible with JSON and allows for unquoted keys, comments, and a few other features. It’s a good match for a human-friendly string like this one. We’ve also added JSON 5 support to our other JSON API in Foundation. Because custom attributes use JSON, anything that can be decoded with JSONDecoder is automatically compatible with the new custom Markdown syntax. Here we have a single attribute, two attributes, one string and one number, and a single attribute with multiple properties. There is just one additional piece here, which is how we connect these names in Markdown to a Swift type. That piece is called an attribute scope. Scopes are a group of attribute keys. Scopes are useful when decoding from JSON or Markdown, because they tell us which attributes we expect to find, their names, and how to decode them. We define one scope each for Foundation, UIKit, AppKit, and SwiftUI. You can define a scope of your own attributes as well. Let’s define a scope for our Caffé App. We’ll nest the scope inside AttributeScopes and conform it to the AttributeScope protocol. Then all we need to do is list the attributes inside our scope with “let.” So far, we have just our rainbow attribute. Next, we’ll include the SwiftUI scope inside of ours. That allows all of those attributes in addition to our own. Scopes nest recursively, so this also includes Foundation attributes. It’s useful to define a property for our new scope. That allows us to use a key path syntax in functions which take the scope as an argument. Finally, we can now load our localized and colorful attributed string from custom Markdown. You’ll also find scope-taking functions for archiving and conversion to and from NSAttributedString. This allows customization of behavior at every step. Here’s the first screen of the Caffé app again, where you can see our custom rainbow attribute in the title. After the localized string is converted from Markdown into an attributed string, the app finds the attribute and applies a fun effect to just that range of the string. Because the attribute comes from our localized strings file, this works correctly for all languages that Caffé supports, like Spanish. We’re just getting started, though. We also have a totally new Formatter API. Formatters are another long-time Foundation feature. They are responsible for taking data, like numbers, dates, times, and more and converting it into a localized and user-presentable string. Formatters are backed by quite a bit of configuration data, so it’s a common pattern to cache and reuse them. However, apps are composed of many distinct pieces of code. It may not always make sense to share a formatter between all of them. Also, because of the large variety of ways that people read dates and times, plus our desire as app authors to present this data in a way that fits our design, there are a lot of opportunities for edge cases. This year, we improved both performance and usability by rethinking our Formatter API from the ground up. In short, our new APIs focus on the format. Let’s take a look at this code from the Earthquakes sample app, where we can see the caching pattern in action. It has a two-step process. First, create and configure a formatter. Next, give the formatter our date and get a string. How could it be simpler? Well, let’s start by removing the requirement to create our own date formatter. It was really easy to forget that this needed to be cached, which would lead to re-creating the same formatter for every cell in the table. Next, the formatting step. Instead of passing our date through the formatter, let’s just use the date itself. Now it’s just one line of code. You specify the format you want, and that’s it. Let’s talk more about this number format. It’s not a lot of code, but it’s hiding some complexity and has a few pitfalls to be aware of. If the argument is not a floating point number, you’ll get entirely the wrong output here. Readers have to be aware of a special case syntax for formatting floating point numbers, along with a set of modifiers that are just string constants. We think this code is easier to understand, maintain, and read. It uses regular Swift functions to specify exactly how we want our number to be formatted. You also get autocompletion and type safety. We’ve applied this new approach to all ten formatters in Foundation. We’ve cleaned up and simplified the interfaces, made changes to help avoid common pitfalls, and added a bunch of new features along the way. Let’s take a look in detail at two of the most popular formatted types: dates and numbers. Date formatting is about using a calendar and time zone to convert an absolute point in time into something a human understands as a date. And even more than that, it takes into account all of the preferences that humans have about how they like their own dates to look. We call those preferences locales. Let’s take a look at the tiny amount of code you need in order to format a date. First, I’ll get the current point in time by using Date.now. Next, I call the formatted function. That's it. Of course, as we just saw in our example, date formatting is something that has a lot of options. So let’s expand this out a bit. The formatted function can be configured to show only the date or only the time. Both of those arguments have several options to pick from. An important goal for this new formatting API is to provide as much compile time help as possible in creating correct formats. Formatting using magic string values is notorious for creating pitfalls, where the format looks correct under normal circumstances but produces entirely the wrong value in edge cases, like at the end of the year. Here again is our default format. This is a short version of asking for the date and time style, like this. For both the no-argument and simple style versions, we pick a default format for you. However, if you want to really customize the date, you just go from here and add the fields you care about. In this example, I build up a format by appending fields to the style. I want only the year, day, and month. Other possibilities include hours, minutes, seconds, and so on. The output format will automatically adjust according to the user’s locale. These fields are also configurable. In this case, I change the month to the wide format, which means that the full month name is printed. Formatting just part of the date is easy with this API as well. Here I want to get just the weekday. Dates can be formatted into different styles, too. Here I choose to use the ISO 8601 format and iso8601, but only with the year, month, and day, and separated with a dash. With these examples, the formatting pattern becomes clear. We start with the value we want to format. We call the formatted function and the argument is the style. There may be more than one kind of style for each type. Date, for example, has both dateTime and iso8601. The style can be used in a default configuration or customized. This formatting API works by specifying a list of fields, some of which have additional options. The order of the fields you provide does not matter. Each field just tells the formatter what values should be included somewhere in the final output. We choose a sensible default for the shortest versions of the API, those with no arguments or just a style name. Once you begin adding fields to that, the output becomes customized and reflects only what you choose to display, somewhat like placeholder text in your UI. There is also a new API for formatting two dates that are relative to each other. Here are some examples. First, formatting two dates in a range. You can just use the regular Swift range syntax with two dates. Formatting ranges allows configuration of showing the date and time, just as we did with a single date. You can format this range as a duration or as components or a single date relative to right now. Another new feature in formatting is attributed output. This allows you to find the location a formatter put a particular part of a formatted value after it is done rearranging it to fit the user’s preferences. This, of course, uses our new struct AttributedString. Applying styling to formatted output shows up in all kinds of places. On watchOS, many of the complications are formatted strings. Since Apple Watch is such a personal device, it’s important to take into account the user’s preferences, but it’s also a place where we want to apply a certain kind of design language, like giving part of a date a color of the user’s choosing. Setting this up is actually quite a lot of fun in SwiftUI. Let’s look at it together in a demo. Here I have the starting point for my Caffé companion app, which shows when your next free coffee is. I’ve got a SwiftUI view which just shows a formatted date. I set the locale on the format so I can control it with my SwiftUI preview here. It’s a pretty good start, but I'd like to customize it a bit more. Let’s begin by making this a little more specific to my app. I only care about the minute, the hour, and the weekday. OK, looking pretty good. Now let’s add a splash of color. First, we’ll change the return type to AttributedString and ask for an attributed output.",

We'll show you how to bring your app to macOS, and explore how the system automatically bridges various features of your app to work on the Mac.

    "video_transcript": "Hello, my name is Nils Beck, and I welcome you to \"Qualities of great iPad and iPhone apps on Macs with M1.\" More than a million iPad and iPhone apps are already available on the Mac App Store. The experience is great on macOS Big Sur, and we've further improved it in macOS Monterey. In this video, we'll discuss how we mapped several iOS APIs to the corresponding Mac features, some general best practices to keep in mind that will also help your app shine on Macs with M1, improvements that we made in macOS Big Sur software updates, as well as in macOS Monterey, and then we'll finish off with Mac App Store deployment considerations. iPad and iPhone apps on Macs with M1 are the easiest way to expand your existing app's reach to the Mac. This is your unmodified iPad or iPhone app, as submitted and approved for the iOS App Store, offered through the Mac App Store to anyone with an M1 Mac. To make this possible, we focus heavily on compatibility. System APIs are mapped to their natural Mac equivalents wherever possible. Our aim is to ensure a smooth app experience on the Mac without you making any changes. And most existing apps work great! This includes everything from small iPhone utilities to cutting-edge iPad games and Pro Apps. A variety of extensions are also supported. For example, share extensions, WidgetKit widgets, photo editing extensions, VPN network extensions, audio units, and more. So, it's very likely that your existing iPad or iPhone app already works well on the Mac, right out of the box. Of course, we support all basic functionality, such as text interactions, copy and paste, a Mac menu bar, and so on, but there is also a lot of advanced functionality, like background app refresh, user notifications, camera access, Siri intents, and more. Many of these topics are discussed in the video, \"iPad and iPhone apps on Apple silicon Macs,\" so check that out for more details. And when you want your app to take advantage of even more of what the Mac has to offer, consider building a Mac Catalyst version of your app. You can learn more about that in the videos, \"Qualities of a great Mac Catalyst app\" and \"What's New in Mac Catalyst.\" Now, let's dive into more detail for some of the APIs I just mentioned. You are likely already using these to make your app great on iPad and iPhone, and we've bridged them to seamlessly give you the same great features on the Mac. Naturally, you can use the Mac keyboard for text input into text fields, as well as for UIKeyCommand keyboard shortcuts. But if you need more control and want to write your own keypress handling, you can do that with the UIPress API on UIResponder. All Macs have a physical keyboard, so apps that have taken the time to add support for physical keyboards on iPad and iPhone are greatly improved on the Mac at the same time. Next, let's talk about the menu bar. As a reminder, the Mac menu bar is intended to help with the discoverability of app features and keyboard shortcuts. The menu bar structure is determined at launch, and should remain more or less constant after that. Items are not added or removed, but rather, they get enabled or disabled, depending on whether they currently apply.",

I'll then follow up with a discussion on some of the ways that Core Data has adopted the new concurrency opportunities in the Swift runtime. Next, I'll cover some of the enhancements we've made to Core Data APIs to make your code more expressive in Swift. And then conclude the discussion with an exploration of the dynamic capabilities that Core Data is adding to our existing SwiftUI support that we introduced in 2020. Let's start at the beginning, though, where regardless of which Apple platform you are developing for, you simply have an application. At some point, your application is going to eventually encounter user data, and you'll likely need to store it somewhere. A great choice for that need is to use Core Data. Core Data is Apple's hallmark framework for application developers who desire to persist their users' data in a robust and feature-rich way. The framework takes care of many of the complexities of appropriately managing user data, from the way it was represented as an object graph in memory to how it's modeled in storage. The framework also goes through great efforts to manage important runtime considerations, like memory use and latency. The capabilities provided by the framework are scalable too. You can start with a simple, locally-persisted store and expand to use multiple execution contexts to improve performance, and even create powerful shared data experiences through CloudKit. Core Data also works across all Apple-supported platforms. And I'd really like to emphasize this last point. Once you start using Core Data, everything you learn will work on each of our platforms, from your Mac, to your iPhone, or even your Apple Watch.",

You may be familiar with some tutorials we've written at Apple. We created tutorials to introduce you to SwiftUI and Mac Catalyst. In these introductory tutorials, you learn the basics of those frameworks and build your skills by following step-by-step code examples. We've found that framework adopters love how quickly they can get started with new ideas presented in tutorials. To make writing these tutorials possible, we built a documentation compiler called DocC. DocC leverages markdown to convert plain text into a rich, interactive system, and this year, we've introduced DocC to Xcode, so you can write tutorials for your Swift package or Swift framework, too. DocC isn't only for developer tutorials. DocC can also build documentation for the Swift frameworks and packages in your project from source comments, which means for app developers, your dependencies can have documentation right alongside platform libraries in the developer documentation window.",

By stepping back in time through my code changes, I can often figure out the cause using code review mode. One of the App Store reviews we had mentioned that some UI changes recently made to our app don't look quite right. I have a pretty good idea what the issues are, so I'll go ahead and start making some changes. As I start typing, the changes appear in the source editor's gutter. I find it really useful to know what the previous values were so I can have a good idea of everything that's changed. For this, I can jump into code review mode.

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hello, I'm Aditya Krishnadevan, an engineer on the UIKit team. At the core of many apps are lists or collection views. Having super-smooth scrolling is a big part of making those apps feel great. This video will set you up for success when making blazing-fast lists and collection views. We'll build this app here that uses collection views to display a list of image posts of some great travel destinations. It's fairly simple at first glance, with a photo of the destination and a couple of text labels. Throughout this video, we'll talk about how it's set up and how it achieves the performance that people expect. First, we'll learn how to start from a strong foundation when using APIs, like diffable data source and cell registrations. We'll refresh our understanding of the life cycle of a collection view cell. We'll then talk about why you might not see perfectly-smooth scrolling, and some advances in prefetching that can help. Finally, Patrick will explain how to correctly update cells when their content comes in asynchronously, and how to use new UIImage API to get the absolute best scrolling performance on all devices. Okay. Let's begin by talking about how the app structures its data. The sample app retrieves a list of posts for display, where each post is represented by this DestinationPost struct. DestinationPost conforms to identifiable, which means it has this ID property that stores its identifier. This is a unique identifier for each DestinationPost that remains stable even if other properties change. Diffable data source is built to store identifiers of items in your model, and not the model objects themselves. So, in the sample app, the diffable data source is populated using the ID property here, and not the DestinationPost itself. Here's the diffable data source used in the app. Like we just discussed, it uses the DestinationPost.ID type for its item identifiers. The Section type here is an enum with one case, as the app has only one section. To populate the data source, the app first creates an empty snapshot and appends the main section. Then, it fetches all the posts from its backing store and appends their identifiers. This way, if one of the other properties of a DestinationPost changes, its representation in diffable data source remains stable, as the identifier does not change. The final step is to apply the snapshot to the data source. Before iOS 15, applying a snapshot without animation would be translated to a reloadData internally. That wasn't great for performance, as the collection view had to discard and recreate all the cells on screen. From iOS 15 onwards, applying a snapshot without animation will only apply the differences and not perform any extra work. With iOS 15, diffable data source also gains a new reconfigureItems method that makes it very easy to update the contents of visible cells. We'll go through how it works later in this video. First, let's get the data from our data source into cells and onto the screen. Cell registrations are a great way to keep all the configuration for each type of cell in one place, and they give us convenient access to the identifiers from diffable data source. UICollectionView maintains a reuse queue for each of instance of a registration, so ensure that you create registrations only once for each type of cell. Here's a simplified registration for cells in the app. The postID that's passed in is used to retrieve a DestinationPost and an asset object containing the image. The properties from the DestinationPost are used to set the title and image in the cell. To use a registration, call dequeueConfiguredReusableCell inside the data source's cell provider. Note how the registration is created outside the cell provider and then used inside. This is important for performance, as creating a registration inside the provider would mean that the collection view would never reuse any of its cells. Now that we understand how to configure a cell, we'll move on to when a cell is configured and what its life cycle is like. The life of a cell is composed of two phases: preparation and display. The first step for preparation is fetching the cell to work on. Whenever UICollectionView needs a cell, it asks for one from its data source. If this is a diffable data source, it runs the cell provider and returns the result. When the cell provider runs, the collection view is asked to dequeue a new cell using a registration. If a cell exists in the reuse pool, UICollectionView will call prepareForReuse on it, and then dequeue the cell. If the reuse pool is empty, it will initialize a new cell. That cell is then passed in to the configuration handler from the registration. This is where apps set up the cell for display for a given item identifier and index path. The configured cell is returned to the collection view for the next step.",

Let's dive right in and take a look at the new Share Sheet in iOS 13. The Share Sheet features a new preview header at the top. This makes it clear what the user is sharing and allows them to customize it. The new Share Sheet also makes it easier to share quickly and effortlessly with the conversation suggestions row that predicts who users will want to share to. Finally, the new actions list offers a clear delineation between apps and actions and puts users' favorite actions at the top for easy access. Now let's talk about how you can take advantage of this new design to enhance your users' sharing experience. First we'll talk about customizing the preview header in the Share Sheet. Then we'll go over opting in to conversation suggestions for your messaging app. And finally, we'll review some best practices. So, let's talk about how to configure a preview header in your Share Sheet. iOS 13 introduces the LinkPresentation API that allows you to present rich links in your app. UIActivityViewController takes advantage of this framework to display the preview header in the Share Sheet. This makes it clear to the user what they're sharing from your app. As an added benefit, when users share via Messages, the link preview in the transcript will match the one from the Share Sheet. This adds continuity to the users' sharing experience. Let's take a look at the preview header in Safari.",

    "video_transcript": "Jon Davis: Hello, I'm Jon Davis, web technologies evangelist for the Safari and WebKit teams. I'm excited to be your guide on how to build and deploy Safari extensions for iOS. Now, there are a couple of different types of extensions for iOS. We've had content blockers on iOS for a few years, and that's a type of extension that allows you to configure powerful rules to block resource loads. But I'm here to tell you about Safari web extensions. They were introduced last year on macOS Big Sur and this fall, we brought them to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. It's a type of extension that uses web technologies that works across other browsers, and our users are loving them. It's the most popular category on the App Store, and they're easy to install, like any other app. And that's because Safari web extensions are distributed with an app. And that means you get the benefits of being on the App Store. Users can discover your extensions, you can easily sell your extensions up front -- You can even take advantage of powerful features like in-app payments to unlock advanced features of your extensions or use TestFlight to run a beta program. But maybe you're saying, \"That's all well and good, John, but I'm a web developer, not an app developer.\" Well, me too! And they asked me to be your guide. So I'm here to help you learn Xcode, and we're going to build a new project from scratch. I'm also going to touch on the privacy-preserving permissions model of Safari and how to submit your extension with some tips on sailing through that App Review process. So let's get started working with Xcode. And to do that, we'll need to download and install it from the App Store. I'm going to launch the App Store, and in Search I'll type \"Xcode\" and it comes up just about right away. And then all you need to do is click the Get button and then click Install. Now, it is a sizeable download that'll take a while but when you're able to launch it, Xcode will prompt you to install Command Line Tools. If you skipped installing them, you can easily do that later from the command line in Terminal. You'll just need to type \"xcode-select\" and add the install flag, and that'll kick off the install process. Now, my environment is ready to go, so I won't run this command now, but you'll want to make sure you have them installed because they include an important tool called the Safari web extension converter. It's useful if you've written a web extension for another browser or one you've written for Safari on macOS that you'd like to upgrade with support for Safari on iOS. Now I have a simple demo web extension in my Documents folder and this hello-world extension is written for another browser, and it simply shows a \"Hello World\" message in a pop-up. Now I can use the converter tool to upgrade it to work with iOS. In Terminal, just type \"xc\", as in Xcode -- so that's \"xcrun\". And then \"safari-web-extension-converter\" and a path to the project. If you have an extension written for Safari on macOS, you can also upgrade it using the converter tool. Just type \"xcrun safari-web-extension-converter\" and add the rebuild-project flag followed by the path to the macOS extension. But let's actually see what the convertor tool does when we run it on the Hello World extension.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Rui Paulo: Hello, everyone, I'm Rui. Today, my colleague Eric and I are going to talk about how you can speed up your app's networking with HTTP/3 and QUIC -- two new protocols available in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey. We'll begin by exploring the evolution of HTTP and how HTTP/3 improves performance. We'll also talk about QUIC, the new transport protocol behind HTTP/3. After that, we'll explain how you can use HTTP/3 in URLSession and how you should configure your HTTP server to support HTTP/3. Finally, we'll take a deep dive into the API for using QUIC and how you can implement your custom networking protocols on top of QUIC. Let's then begin with the evolution of HTTP. Let's say we need to fetch a resource. We set up a connection, send the request, wait for the server to process it, and receive a response. Now, if we want to fetch another resource before the first one finishes, we have go through the same process again: setting up a connection, sending the request, waiting for processing, and receiving the response, this time indicated in dark green. Here's another example for a third resource, in orange. As outlined by the diagram, a lot of time is spent on connection setup. What if we reuse a single HTTP/1 connection? We saved the connection set up time, but a request can only be sent after the previous response has ended. This is known as head-of-line blocking. In the past, HTTP implementations used many parallel connections to overcome this problem. The number of parallel HTTP connections was even configurable by the app. However, this led to inefficient networking behaviors for both client and server. HTTP/2 solves head-of-line blocking by multiplexing multiple streams on a single connection. Requests are sent earlier, and data from different streams can be interleaved. This allows more efficient use of a single TCP connection, as idle waiting time is drastically reduced. With HTTP/3, connection set up is much faster, so requests can go out sooner. However, that's not the only benefit of HTTP/3. HTTP/3 streams are independent, which is different from HTTP/2, where all streams share a single TCP connection. On most networks, packets are lost. This is a normal event on wireless networks and a natural part of detecting the capacity of a network. In HTTP/2, packet loss may affect many streams since all of the HTTP/2 streams share a single TCP connection. In HTTP/3, only the corresponding HTTP stream is affected. Data that belongs to other streams can be delivered earlier. We've just shown how HTTP/3 can establish a connection sooner and how it can better cope with packet loss. These improvements are enabled by the underlying transport protocol: QUIC. QUIC is a new reliable transport protocol that has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force. It's based on the same concepts of TCP but provides end-to-end encryption, multiplexed streams, and authentication. QUIC's security builds on top of the well-known TLS 1.3 protocol. The major benefit of QUIC is improved performance. Let's explore how QUIC achieves just that. QUIC relies on TLS 1.3 to perform a secure handshake and does not require the familiar TCP three-way handshake, reducing the handshake time to a single round trip. Multiplexed streams are a key concept of QUIC, so it doesn't suffer from head-of-line blocking. A QUIC endpoint is able to communicate more complex information about packets it has received to the other endpoint and is not encumbered by TCP's limits, so QUIC connections experience improved loss recovery. The protocol also supports connection migration which allows connections to move seamlessly across different network interfaces without reestablishing a session, for example, between cellular networks and Wi-Fi. If you would like to learn more about networking delays, please watch the \"Reduce network delays for your app\" session. Let's talk about how you can use HTTP/3 in your app. If you're using URLSession, you don't need to change your app since iOS 15 and macOS Monterey ship with HTTP/3 enabled by default. Once you enable HTTP/3 on your server, you're good to go. Both the upcoming HTTP/3 RFC version and the earlier HTTP/3 Draft version 29 are supported. So how can you make sure your app is using HTTP/3? Let's use Instruments to find out! In Xcode 13, we're introducing a new instrument within the networking profiling template to inspect HTTP Traffic. It taps into URLSession directly, so there's no setup required. We can use Instruments to find out if our app is using HTTP/3 or an earlier HTTP version. We're going to launch an iOS app that, upon starting, fetches a set of dog pictures. We'll then inspect HTTP headers to find out how the server is advertising HTTP/3. Let's go ahead and select the Network profiling template.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Ali de Jong: Welcome to WWDC 2021. My name is Ali de Jong, and I'm a GPU software engineer at Apple. And today, along with my colleague David Núñez Rubio, we'll explore hybrid rendering with Metal ray tracing. We'll start by showing you some improvements that ray tracing can bring to your visuals; then discuss how to incorporate a ray tracing pass into rasterization, using a technique called \"hybrid rendering;\" then David will walk us through the new tools to help you implement ray tracing. Let's start by taking a look at some great use cases for ray tracing. Games and movies are in the constant pursuit of ever-increasing realism, and for many years, the approach to graphics has been by means of rasterization. Rasterization is great at producing beautiful images at real-time rates. However, there are limitations to what we can achieve. Ray tracing is a mechanism that allows us to query the world from shaders, opening the door to new, exciting techniques. And by combining it with rasterization, we can greatly improve our visuals. Let's take a look at a few examples. One area that's always been problematic for rasterization is reflections. This is because when we're shading a rasterized pixel, we have no context of the rest of the scene for accurate reflections and we have to do extra work to generate that information. Ray tracing allows us to trace array from the pixel being shaded and discover what's out there in the world. Even better, we can apply this process recursively to apply correct shadows and even reflections in reflections. Another area where ray tracing excels is shadows. Notice with rasterization, the shadows' general blurriness and the aliasing caused by a shadow map resolution on the curved surfaces of the moped. Ray-traced shadows are sharper and address aliasing issues without the need of artificial parameters such as a shadow bias. Soft shadows can also be approximated more accurately. We can naturally produce shadows that are harder or softer, depending on the proximity of the occluding object to the shaded point. With rasterization, we would need to rely on filtering the shadow map at sampling time. But with ray tracing, we can simply trace rays in a cone to get this result. Lastly, another area where ray tracing can elevate our visuals is transparency. This is traditionally very hard to handle accurately for rasterization techniques. In this image, note how the sunlight is coming through the window, yet the opaque letters on the glass produce no shadow. Traditional shadow-mapping techniques often have problems with transparent objects. With ray tracing, we can create a custom intersection function for transparent materials. With this, we can define which rays are able to pass through the material and which ones don't, naturally producing projected shadows like the letters on the head of the bust. And of course, all the shadows look sharper overall. So why is it that ray tracing is able to improve our visuals so dramatically? To understand this, let's take a look at how the traditional rasterization process works. In the rasterization process, meshes are sent down to Metal to be rendered. They are placed in the world and in front of the camera by a vertex shader, and those primitives are placed onto pixels -- or fragments -- by the rasterizer. These pixels are then shaded by a fragment shader, and the result is blended onto the output image. As you know, each pixel can be shaded independently, operating in parallel, which is what makes GPUs so good at the rasterization process. The tradeoff, however, is at the time we're applying our shading, we've completely lost the context of the rest of our scene and we don't know what objects might be surrounding the point associated with this pixel. Advanced game engines make up for this situation by adding extra render passes that generate intermediate information. The fragment shader can then leverage that data to approximate the details of the geometric context the point is in. Let's take a look at how this works in a bit more detail. For this technique, you rasterize geometric information about the scene to intermediate textures instead of directly to the screen. This can be things like albedo, depth, or normals. This is commonly referred to as a Geometry Buffer pass or G-Buffer pass for short. The intermediate textures are used as input for light approximation passes that use smart tricks to approximate how the light would interact with the objects in the scene. Some examples are screen-space ambient occlusion and screen-space reflection. In the last step, our intermediate attachments are often denoised or blurred slightly to make for a smoother image, and everything is combined together to produce the final image. While these sometimes elaborate techniques can help improve the image, they're still just approximations. On the other hand, ray tracing takes a completely different approach that enables more accurate visuals and simplified visual techniques. Instead of processing meshes one at a time, in ray tracing, we build an acceleration structure that encompasses the whole scene. Once we have that, we can have the GPU trace rays from a point toward a given direction and find intersections. This gives us access to all the contextual scene information. Since ray tracing models ray interactions, it has applications beyond rendering, too. It can be used for audio and physics simulation, collision detection, or AI and pathfinding. Since ray tracing is such a powerful technique, we'd like to bring together ray tracing and rasterization to get the unique benefits of each, and we can do so through a technique called \"hybrid rendering.\" Now let's look at how to create a hybrid rendered frame and some use cases for this technique. If we start from our rasterized frame diagram, we can use ray tracing to replace some or all of our light approximation passes. We still rasterize our G-Buffer -- it plays the role of our primary rays -- and then we use ray tracing to more realistically simulate the properties of light by querying into the rest of the scene. We still denoise and do a light composition pass, but our results are much more accurate to the scene data. This frame architecture provides a good foundation to explore a number of hybrid rendering techniques. Let's take a look at how we can encode a frame like this using Metal. We start with filling out our G-Buffer. To do so, we create a render pass and fill out a G-Buffer and set its textures as the attachments for our pass. We make sure our images are stored to memory so the rendered contents are available to subsequent passes. We start our pass, encode our rendering, and end the render pass. Next, we'll add a ray-tracing compute dispatch to this. So after we create the intermediate textures, let's encode our ray-tracing pass. We create the compute pass from the same command buffer and make sure to set the G-Buffer textures as inputs. By default, Metal will track write-read dependencies for you, so you're free to focus on your algorithm without being too concerned by synchronization. Since this is compute, we set our output textures to write the results of our ray-tracing work. We set the PipelineState object for our ray-tracing technique. Each thread in the compute shader will calculate the ray-tracing result for a pixel or region. Finally, we dispatch our 2D grid and end this pass. After this pass is encoded, we can now continue to encode more work such as the light accumulation pass, or we can submit the command buffer now so the GPU starts working on it while we encode the rest of the frame. Since we encoded our work in two passes, this requires saving our intermediate render attachments to system memory for the passes to communicate with each other. This works, but on Apple Silicon and iOS devices there's an opportunity to make this even better. On Apple GPUs, the hardware utilizes tile memory to hold our pixel data as we work on it. At the end of the pass, this tile memory is fleshed out to system memory and must be reloaded at the beginning of the next pass. Ideally, though, we would have the compute passes work directly on tile memory, avoiding the round trips to system memory. I'm excited to share this year we've added the ability to do that by dispatching ray-tracing work from render pipelines. This allows mixing render and compute via tile shaders in a single pass to leverage on-tile memory for ray tracing. This will reduce bandwidth use, memory consumption, and help your users' devices run cooler. Please make sure to review our 2019 \"Modern rendering with Metal\" session to learn how to efficiently mix render and compute, so you can apply that for ray tracing from render; as well as this year's \"Enhance your app with Metal ray-tracing\" session to learn about other improvements coming to Metal ray tracing this year. Now that we know how to encode a hybrid rendering workload, let's review some techniques that can be improved with ray tracing. We'll focus on shadows, ambient occlusion, and reflections. Let's start with shadows. Shadows help convey the proximity of objects to each other within the scene. This is a challenge for rasterization, though, because we lose the context of the scene at the time of shading. Shadow mapping can help supplement this lack of information but requires extra rendering from each light's point of view. This rasterization technique starts by rendering the scene from every light's perspective. This produces a series of depth maps that need to be stored alongside each light's transformation matrix. Then we render from the main camera's perspective. To shade each pixel, we need to convert the point to the light's coordinates. We sample the depth coming from the depth map and ultimately compare these depth values to determine if we're in light or shadow for each light source. There's a couple of drawbacks with this technique. First, we'll have to render the scene from the light's perspective for each light. This means processing the scene multiple times. Second, the shadow maps have a predetermined resolution, which means our shadows will be subject to aliasing; and worse, we won't have information for pixels that didn't fit in the image. Let's compare this to ray-traced shadows. To compute shadows with ray tracing, we can simply trace a ray from a point toward the direction of the light source and determine if any object is blocking its path. If we don't find anything, that means the point should take this light source into consideration for shading. In the case an object is blocking the path, we just exclude that light source's contribution in the lighting equation. Notice how this produces a natural shadow corresponding to the silhouette of the occluding object. Even better, we're no longer limited to the information stored in a depth map. We can determine shadows for points outside the light's frustum or camera's view. Let's see how our shadow technique is simplified with ray tracing. We start by rendering from the main camera. Next, we take the acceleration structure and the depth map rendered from the camera's position and feed it into our ray-tracing kernel. Calculate the pixel position, and then we simply trace a ray in the light's direction From this, we determine if the point is lit or in shadow, depending on whether an intersection was found with an occluding object. This process produces a shadow texture that we can then combine with our render pass results to get the final image. Let's look at how to code a Metal shader to do this. In our shader code, we start by calculating the position each thread will process from the depth and the thread_id. We create our shadow ray from the calculated position and set it up to trace in the light's direction. For most light types, like point lights, spotlights, and area lights, we set the min and max to trace all the way from the point to the light source. For directional shadows, we may want to set the max to infinity. Additionally, if we decide to implement cone ray tracing for softer shadows, this is a great place to add jitter to our shadowRay. We then create an intersector object. If we find any one intersection, that means we're in shadow, so we configure the intersector to accept any intersection. Finally, we intersect against the acceleration structure. Based on that intersection result, we write whether the point is lit or not, which creates a shadow texture that's more accurate to the scene. When that shadow texture is applied, you can see we get much more realistic shadows and get rid of the aliasing. With ray tracing, determining shadows becomes a very natural technique. We just trace a ray to find if something occludes the light source for that point or not. There is no longer a need to have intermediate depth maps, and we can avoid having multiple extra render passes for each light. This technique is easy to implement into a deferred or forward renderer, as it only depends on depth. And finally, it allows for custom intersection functions for translucent materials. Next, let's take a look at ambient occlusion. Conceptually, a point surrounded by geometry is less likely to receive a large amount of ambient light. Ambient occlusion consists in muting the ambient light received at a point based on how busy its neighborhood is, which naturally darkens crevices, giving the final image more depth. Rasterization techniques to achieve this depend on sampling the depth and normals in the neighborhood of the point, to determine if there are objects surrounding and potentially occluding it. Based on how many nearby objects are found, we calculate an attenuation factor to mute the ambient light and create a texture to apply to our image. Relying on screen-space information like depth buffer and surface normals, however, is missing information for nonvisible occluders and objects outside the border of the image. With ray tracing, instead of relying on screen-space information, we can rely on actual geometric data of our scene. The idea is for every pixel to shade, we generate random rays in a hemisphere and search for intersections against objects. If any intersections are found, we take it into consideration for our ambient occlusion factor. We start again with the acceleration structure. For this technique, we require normal data as well as depth, so we collect those in our G-Buffer pass. The depth and normals are used to generate the random rays in the hemisphere. Next, we trace rays and calculate the attenuation factor. This produces an image where crevices are naturally darkened, creating the effect. Let's take a look at a Metal shader for ambient occlusion. First, we generate the random rays. In this case, we take a cosineWeightedRay along the normal in each thread. We set the max_distance to a small number, as we're only interested in a small neighborhood. Next, we create our intersector and intersect the acceleration structure. Depending on the result, we accumulate into our attenuation factor. Here's a side-by-side comparison. And we can immediately see how much better the ray-traced approach looks. I want to highlight a few places that really show the limitations of a screen-space effect. Here is an example where the neighborhood is misrepresented due to limited screen-space information. This is because the actual geometry is almost perpendicular to the camera and, therefore, not in the depth buffer at this angle. The same problem occurs across the image, in particular, under the moped. From this angle, the bottom of the moped is missing from the depth buffer. So the screen-space technique completely misses the attenuation. The ray-traced version, on the other hand, correctly discovers the intersections against the bottom of the moped for the floor pixels. And here's a great example of the limitations around the screen border. The occluding geometry is offscreen, so its contribution is lost in the screen-space technique, but accounted for in ray tracing. As we can see, hybrid rendering provides a significant quality improvement by using the actual geometry of the scene, freeing the technique from limitations in screen-space information. And finally, let's take a look at reflections. Reflections have traditionally been very difficult for rasterization. Reflection probes is a technique that works well but is limited in resolution, requires filtering, and struggles with dynamic geometry. Screen-space reflection techniques are limited by screen-space information. Reflection probes are a solution that requires strategically placing cameras along the entire scene to capture surrounding color information. To use reflection probes, cube maps are captured from different locations in the scene. This is essentially a rendering of the scene in six directions from the same point. When a pixel is shaded, you calculate the relation to the probes and sample the cube maps to produce the reflected shading. For realistic results, usually many probes need to be scattered across the scene. And as dynamic objects move across the scene, shaders need to sample from more than one cube map and manually interpolate reflected colors. The cube maps also need to be prefiltered to accurately represent irradiance and are limited in resolution. Another rasterization technique, screen-space reflection, avoids some of these problems by basing its reflections on pixels already on the framebuffer. The fragment shader uses the normals to incrementally march outwards and check the depth map for potential nearby objects. If we find something, we sample the color directly from the frame buffer and shade it onto the output image. It does suffer, however, from the screen-space limitations we discussed earlier. Notice in this moped example how only part of the surface can get an accurate reflection, corresponding to the floor tiles present in the framebuffer. The rest of the scene is missing. Worse, the lower portion behind the fender, marked in yellow, is missing information; we have no way of knowing what the surface facing away from the camera would look like. The ray marching can also get computationally expensive. Ray-traced reflections, however, helps us overcome both sets of problems, as we can rely on the true scene information in the acceleration structure. Let's take a look at how a perfect mirror would work. First, we take the incident ray from the camera's position to the point. Then, we reflect this point on the normal associated with the point. This provides us with a direction we can trace a ray towards, and find any reflected objects. For this, we provide our reflection ray-tracing kernel with the normals and depth of the G-Buffer. This ray-tracing kernel calculates the view vector, from the camera to each point, reflects this vector, and traces a ray in that direction from the point. Finally, for accurate reflections, we can shade the intersection found directly in the ray-tracing kernel. Let's take a look at coding this shader. Once again, we start from the point's depth, and reconstruct its position. This time, we want the position to be in world space. So in our calculatePosition function, we'll need to multiply the inverse of the view matrix. Then, we calculate our reflected incident vector over the normal and create a ray in that direction. Next, we create our intersector and trace our reflectedRay. If we hit an object, we now shade that point to produce the reflection. If the intersection missed all objects, we can just sample a skybox and return its color to simulate a reflection that's showing the sky. Note that the shading is performed directly in the compute kernel for this technique. Let's compare reflection probes to ray-traced reflections. The image on the right used hybrid rendering, and we can see the details of the floor tiles much more clearly. The buildings are present, and we can even see shadows reflected on the front panel of the moped. Reflections are a natural fit for ray tracing. It nicely handles mirror-like reflections and rough reflections. Those can be achieved by tracing multiple rays along a cone and filtering the results. Because they rely on perfect information coming from the acceleration structure, ray-traced reflections are free from screen-space artifacts and can handle both static and dynamic geometry in the scene. Now, one important detail: we mentioned that for reflections, we need to shade the point directly in the compute kernel. Some techniques like this one or global illumination require accessing vertex data and Metal resources from the compute kernel directly. For these cases we need to make sure the GPU has access to the data that it needs to apply our shading equations. This is achieved with a bindless binding model which in Metal is represented as argument buffers. Please make sure to check out this year's \"Bindless rendering in Metal\" talk for more detail. We just saw how hybrid rendering can be put into practice with several different techniques. This leads to more natural algorithms that also have the advantage of producing more accurate results. In some cases, when we compare to the traditional rasterization techniques, we see that we can remove render passes and save memory and bandwidth in some cases. With the addition of ray tracing from render, we can even keep our entire work on chip. Ray-tracing adoption is a big task, and we have excellent new tooling to assist you in the process of bringing these techniques to your engine. This year, we're introducing tools that enable you to capture ray-tracing work, inspect acceleration structures, and inspect visible and intersection functions. Now David will give us a tour of these new tools. David Núñez Rubio: Thanks, Ali. My name is David Núñez Rubio, and I am a GPU software engineer. Last year, we introduced ray-tracing support in Metal. However, developing complex application can be challenging. Fortunately, Metal Debugger is here to help you. This year, we introduced ray-tracing support in Metal Debugger. Thanks to the adoption of hybrid rendering, our demo is looking better than ever. Ray-traced soft shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion; the results are amazing. During development of the demo, we hit some issues. This is how tools can help you resolving these problems. In this early version of the demo, ray-traced shadows have already been implemented. But if you look carefully, you'll notice missing shadows from the tree leaves on the ground. It is more obvious if we compare with the reference version. See reference versus ray traced. Let's jump into Xcode and take a capture to see how the tools can help us debugging this issue. We need to press the Metal button and click on Capture. Since this is a static problem, we just need a single frame. In the debugger, API calls are organized in the left side on the debug navigator. Let's unfold the offscreen command buffer to look for our shadow encoding. I have labeled my compute command encoder as \"Raytrace Shadows.\" It is a good practice to label your Metal objects so you can easily find them in the Metal Debugger. The thumbnail also gives us a hint that, indeed, this is the encoder we are looking for. We can now click on the dispatch Threadgroups API call to show band resources. This is a list of all the objects associated with our current kernel dispatch. And here, we can see an acceleration of structure, which we have conveniently labeled as well. Our kernel uses an acceleration structure to cast rays. This is commonly implemented as a bounding volume hierarchy or BVH, which is a tree-like data structure representing the 3D world that rays will intersect. Now, double-click to open the acceleration structure viewer.",

I am happy to share with you the important updates we have made in WebKit and Safari for web developers in the past year. The things I'm about to share generally fall into three categories. First, I will walk you through new features and enhancements in JavaScript. Then I will give you an overview of the updates in WebAssembly. And finally, I will introduce you to some new web APIs that can add additional capabilities to your web content. There is a lot to cover, so let’s begin with our news in JavaScript. Each year, there are hundreds of changes made in our JavaScript engine. I will cover some of the most important ones you need know if you work with JavaScript. They are: new class field syntax, weak references that enables smarter memory management, new usage of the await keyword, support for modules in workers, and interfaces added to Internationalization API family. To put you in the picture of these new features, I'm going to use a simple stopwatch as example. The stopwatch has only one button. Click it once, it begins counting. Click it again, it will stop and give you the duration passed. Keep this in mind and we will implement it later in JavaScript. Now, let’s take a look at the new class field syntax. We have new private class fields and methods that let you define real private members whose access is protected by the language. You will see an error if you break the access rules. We also add support for static fields, which allows you to declare a class member that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Now you have the basic idea. Let’s check how it can be used with the stopwatch example. If you are asked to implement the stopwatch class, your implementation may look like this. StopwatchWithOneButton has only one method named click(). It checks startTime variable. If start time is unset, the click means to start, so it will set the start time. If start time is already set, the click means to stop, so it will calculate a duration and reset the start time. You can see startTime comes with an underscore prefix. This is a naming convention commonly used to denote that the variable should only be used inside of the class. But that does not actually prevent the start time from being accessed publicly. The new private syntax can help fix this. Just replace the underscore with hash, and you can declare a real private instance field. The encapsulation is enforced by the language. There is also support for private methods. For example, to make click() methods more structured, we can create two private methods start() and stop() to replace the highlighted content, like this. By adding the hash prefix to methods, we make sure the member functions can only be accessed from inside of the class. The new private syntax also applies to static fields like startedStopwatchCount. Here, startedStopwatchCount can only be modified by stopwatch objects at start or stop times. Of course, if you want startedStopwatchCount to be accessed everywhere, you can declare it as public static field, without the hash prefix. Public static field is also available in WebKit now. Private instance fields, methods, private static fields, and public static fields; that’s our new class field support. And let’s continue to another feature, weak references. Weak references allow you to hold reference to a JavaScript object in a way that does not prevent garbage collection. Unlike WeakMap and WeakSet, you can get the underlying object without already having a reference to it. The support also includes notification on garbage collection, so you may perform some cleanup task if you need to. And let’s see how it can be used. We just implemented the stopwatch class. Now imagine you have created multiple stopwatch objects for different tasks. For testing, you need to click all of them at a time. How would you do that? An intuitive way is to keep a set of all stopwatch instances. When the stopwatch is created, add it to the set. Then in clickAllStopwatches function, iterate the set and click each stopwatch. But there is an issue with this approach. We know JavaScript objects hold strong reference by default, so in this case all stopwatch objects cannot be garbage collected because the set still has reference to them. Of course, we don’t want to keep all stopwatch objects around just for testing. This is not great for memory use. Now, you may suggest just replacing Set with WeakSet, but WeakSet is not iterable. So what would you do? We can solve it with the new interface WeakRef, which holds weak references to an object. We still have the set, but this time we add WeakRef of stopwatch objects to the set. In clickAllStopwatches function, we check if the object still exists by dereferencing it before clicking. This seems to solve our issue, but there is another problem: we don’t remove garbage-collected stopwatches from the set in a timely manner, and the set can grow quite large before our next click test. Now what should we do? Another new interface -- FinalizationRegistry -- may help in this case. With it, you can specify a callback to be invoked at when some object is garbage collected. Here we create a finalizationRegistry object with removeStopwatch function, so this function is called every time an object is collected. Then, we register stopwatch objects to the registry. Each stopwatch is bound with an identifier, so removeStopwatch knows which stopwatch to remove. Good, now garbage-collected stopwatches will be removed from allStopwatches. The usage of weak references sounds not that hard, right? But be aware that garbage collection in JavaScript is very complicated, and there is a lot of uncertainty. For example, the object you think should be collected may not actually be collected until a long time after, and you may not get the callback from FinalizationRegistry right way because it runs on event loop. Therefore, make sure you fully understand the syntax and its expected behavior before use. Let’s move on from weak references to the next feature, top-level await. This is a new feature for modules. It enables you to use the await keyword outside of the async function. In this case, the module itself is like a big async function, so an async module can block the execution of the module importing them. Let me show you an example with our stopwatch class. This is the class we just created. To illustrate a use of top-level await, let’s make it a module and export the class. This is an HTML file that contains an inline module. It imports the stopwatch module using dynamic import. The import function returns a promise, so we can use then or catch methods to perform actions after import is done. With top-level await, you can remove the chaining methods and write the code in a synchronous way. This can make your code easier to follow. Also, because imported modules are evaluated at load time, so an async module can block execution of modules depending on it. That means if stopwatch module runs async operations and waits for result, the stopwatch variable here will be initialized after stopwatch module finishes execution. Top-level await has made it easier to do dependency management. But again, this feature is only available in modules, so if the script is not a module, like this...",

    "video_transcript": "Hello. Mail is a crucial application, and Mail app extensions will let you enhance it in some incredible new ways. I'm Abhilash, and along with my colleague, Seth, we are going to walk you through how to build great Mail app extensions. In macOS Monterey, we are shipping a new framework, MailKit, for building Mail extensions. These extensions are built on the same underlying foundation as other app extensions like Safari app extensions and share sheet extensions. They are built with user privacy and security in mind in mind from the ground up. MailKit APIs are well documented and will be supported across major macOS releases. Like other app extensions, they can be in any properly signed Mac app, can be bundled in your existing apps, and can also be distributed in the App Store. Mail extensions are the future of extending Mail. Plug-ins will stop functioning in a future macOS release. We are introducing four new ways you can extend Mail's user experience. First, compose extensions will allow new workflows when composing mail messages. Action extensions help people manage their inbox by providing custom rules on incoming messages. Content blocking extensions provide WebKit content blockers for Mail messages. Finally, message security extensions can provide further security by signing, encrypting, and decrypting messages when people send and receive mail. This provides a full suite of Mail extensions to help compose messages, take action on incoming messages, block undesired mail content and provide encryption and decryption. They are easy to write. They are very powerful. They are stable and will continue to work as the OS and Mail app change over time. Before we dive in to build a Mail extension with these capabilities, let's go through an example of one in use. Imagine I am working for a large multinational corporation where all my colleagues are collaborating on multiple highly secretive projects. To help preserve secrecy of our projects, we are using a Big Secrecy Extension that validates recipients of a mail message. I want to send a message to my colleague Seth for an update on our new remote office on Mars. The first thing you notice is a button for the Big Secrecy Extension in the Mail compose window. This extension provides a list of projects I'm working on, and I pick Mars Remote Office. I type in a subject and Seth's email. The extension was able to validate that Seth is disclosed on this project and annotates his email address with a blue checkmark. Of course, for a project of this importance, we do want to keep our manager, Mikey, informed, so I'm going to add him. Hmm, looks like Mikey is not disclosed about our new remote office.

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Mathieu Tozer: Hi, I'm Mathieu Tozer, and I'm an engineer on the macOS SwiftUI team. SwiftUI is a multiplatform framework at its core, with the goal of making it easy to build great apps everywhere. When approaching any new concept or API, we take a step back and consider what each platform expects from that feature. What's great about SwiftUI is that its APIs and concepts apply to all platforms, and in this talk we're going to show how those are fine-tuned for the Mac. This is a code-along, where you'll be downloading a skeleton project and writing a Mac app with me. Before we start, let's look over some of the key principles that go into great Mac apps that we'll refer back to while working on our app. These are flexible, familiar, expansive, and precise. Mac Apps are flexible, adjusting to how each of us individually use them. This starts with how we physically use our Macs from keyboards, mice, trackpads, switch controls, even iPads -- and then extends to the software itself. I can customize my workflow by adjusting table columns, sidebars, detail panels, display modes, and windows in a way that suits me best, and the interface will adapt. And at the same time, Mac apps are familiar. Using controls and design patterns consistent with the system makes an app immediately approachable, thanks to a common visual language. For example, the File menu is where I always reach to create new things, and the search bar has a consistent look across all my app toolbars. You can make your app more approachable by zoning out areas of a window, keeping navigation and hierarchy in the sidebar, content in the center, and user functions along the top and right-hand side. But that consistency can still leave room for apps to be unique and stand out among others. You can add customization, such as the app accent color. And when you find you need a custom control, it should be designed to fit in with the system controls. Mac apps are expansive. Large, often multiple displays mean more information can be organized on screen without being hidden away in drill-in style navigation stacks. Concretely, expansive means using controls like sidebars with outline views and thumbnail previews, popovers for transient elements, tabs to toggle between panes of controls, and disclosure groups to display content. Finally, Mac apps are precise. They not only have large windows, but their views also have tighter margins and spacing that results in high densities of content and controls, and these controls are designed to be used with a mouse pointer. All that said, increased density doesn't need to result in increased complexity; an app that serves a simple, single purpose can still be a great Mac app. You probably recognize these ideas from your favorite Mac apps. We'll next be applying these ideas in practice. I'm going to be building a Mac app with you. Hit Pause here and download the project, which will contain the starting and end points for this session. I really like to garden. I think it would be great to have a dedicated app to track my gardens over the years. We're going to build this app for the Mac. We'll take advantage of platform features such as flexible windowing and high information density, enabling me to really interact with my app's data in a way that feels great on macOS. On the left, I have a sidebar showing an outline view of all my garden projects. I can select a garden and see all the plant details in a table view, or as a gallery. Let's start implementing this app. Open up the Session1.workspace in the starter project. We have a garden structure that contains an array of plants, and we have some views and helpers to speed us along, but we'll get started in the ContentView. I'm just going to collapse my sidebar and make some room for my Xcode previews. Our Mac app will have a two-column layout. I'm going to embed this text view in a NavigationView. I'm going to remove the padding, and I'll change the text to a Sidebar. The second column will be for our Plant Table. This flattened hierarchy provides a solid foundation for an expansive navigation experience on the Mac's big screens. Let's get going on our sidebar. If I Command-click, I can extract this view into its own subview, and I'll rename it to \"Sidebar\". I need access to my store.",

There are a huge number of Apple developers streaming content using our very popular HTTP live streaming. Over the years, the usage has evolved into multiple complex delivery scenarios. The developers are doing live event broadcasts, prerecorded , and in each of these there are possibly multiple different media selections, variance at different bit rates, audio and subtitles of different languages. The content itself might be protected and there could possibly be millions of simultaneous viewers subscribing to your streams. Given the enormity the system is bound to run into errors. A lot of developers and content providers have asked us one question in particular over the years, what is the right thing to do when an error happens. And on very popular demand, we present to you today the best practices for handling errors on both app and the server side. Most of you listening to this talk might already know all about HLS delivery, but let's quickly go through the overview.

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Ross LeBeau: Hi, and welcome to WWDC21. My name is Ross LeBeau, and I'm an engineer on the StoreKit team. Today, we're going to be talking about StoreKit, and this is actually one of three sessions designed to help you implement client-side code, build out your server for in-app purchase, and support your customers and handle refunds. This session is Meet StoreKit 2, and you can find the other two sessions here at WWDC21. This session will focus on client-side features and implementation. So let's get started! Since StoreKit was introduced in iOS 3, it's created great opportunities for you and your businesses. Today, it exists on four Apple platforms and supports everything from games to news apps, indie titles to international hits. Over the years, we've introduced great features such as offer codes, Family Sharing, and StoreKit testing in Xcode. But this year, we decided to go back to the beginning. Today, I'm excited to introduce you to StoreKit 2! StoreKit 2 is a brand new set of modern and flexible Swift APIs for working with In-App Purchase across iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. We've taken a new look at StoreKit with a Swift-first mindset. We embraced some of the newest language features, like Swift concurrency using the async/await pattern, to create simple yet powerful APIs. We've also made some huge updates to the in-app purchase transactions, making them much easier to work with, while also providing more information and high security. And we've added more powerful APIs specifically for subscriptions in order to give you deeper insight that you can use to grow your business. StoreKit 2 APIs live inside the same StoreKit framework that exists today and focus on the core in-app purchase experience rather than replacing every API. The new StoreKit 2 APIs are comprised of five major areas: Products, Purchases, Transaction info, Transaction history, and subscription status. Today I'm going to give you an overview of each of these areas, and my colleague Jakob will be showing you how to use the corresponding StoreKit 2 APIs in real code. So first, let's start with the building blocks of StoreKit: products and purchases. The StoreKit 2 product struct is a supercharged version of the StoreKit product object you're used to. To start, we've added additional data to it, such as the product type and extended subscription information. With StoreKit 2, we're making it easier to do things like find out if the customer is eligible for your introductory offer. We're also making StoreKit 2 products forward-compatible with new features. We've accomplished this by adding a wrapping type called BackingValue that allows you to retrieve data contained in the product by subscripting the products directly. This means that if we add data to products in the future, you'll always be able to access them in StoreKit 2, even on SDKs and devices running operating systems that have older versions of StoreKit 2. This means that you can use the latest features to provide new functionality to a larger section of your customer base. With StoreKit 2, you request products by calling a static function on the product type itself. This requests product metadata from the App Store just like the existing SKProductsRequest does. But thanks to the new Swift concurrency async/await pattern, the StoreKit 2 product request requires just one line of code. Similarly, purchasing a product in StoreKit 2 is another simple, one-line task. Purchase is now an instance method on the product type, meaning you can take those products you just retrieved and call purchase directly on them. Since the purchase method also uses async/await, you get the result of your purchase inline in your code. Now we know that not every purchase is the same. If you want to modify purchase behavior beyond the default settings, StoreKit 2 has Purchase options. A Purchase option is an item that describes a single property of a purchase. You can compose Purchase options into a set which you pass into the purchase method. StoreKit 2 includes purchase options for things such as quantity and promotional offers. And in StoreKit 2, we're adding a new option called App account token. The App account token is a way for you to keep track of which of your app's user accounts began and completed a transaction. It’s an opaque token that you generate which you can link to accounts that your app owns. It's easy to generate an App account token, because the only requirement is that it conforms to the UUID format. You send up an App account token on the purchase as a Purchase option, and this token is returned in the transaction info for that purchase. The App account token stays in the transaction info forever, even across devices. If your app supports its own account system, this can help you keep track of which purchases each in-app account has made, regardless of the Apple ID or device that was used to purchase them. So, we've talked about getting products from the App Store and initiating a purchase; now what happens when that purchase completes? As you might expect, StoreKit is going to return a successful transaction to you along with cryptographically signed information. Sounds familiar, right? Well, StoreKit 2 is bringing the biggest update to in-app purchase transactions ever. To start, StoreKit 2 will be providing an individually signed object for every transaction. Not only that, but starting in StoreKit 2, in-app purchase transaction info will now be provided in a very common, easy-to-work-with format: JSON. And since we know that secure cryptographic signing is an important part of StoreKit purchases, we're now using a common standard used across the web known as JSON Web Signature. Plus, all the information contained in the signed object will now be available through native StoreKit APIs, making it easy to work with this data in your app's code. In fact, we'll show you just how easy it is. Here's Jakob with a demonstration of these APIs in real code. Jakob Swank: Hi, I'm Jakob. I'm an engineer on the StoreKit team. I'm really excited today to be showing you how easy it is to get up and running with StoreKit 2 in your app. On the right, I have an app I'm building called Pocket Cars. You can download the sample code for this app in the resources section of this session and follow along. The app has two main views. There's a view for my collected cars and a view for my store. Let's go over to the store. Currently, my store is empty because I have no products available for sale. I'm going to go ahead and implement those now. To get up and running quickly, I'm using StoreKit testing in Xcode. This allows me to build and test my store before defining products in App Store Connect. In my Xcode project, I've already created a StoreKit configuration file defining the products I want to sell. This is the same configuration file I was using for StoreKit; I don't need to change or migrate anything. Here, I also have a plist containing all my product identifiers. It's included as a resource file built into my app so I can use it at runtime. To display these products in my store, I first need to make a product request using a set of the product identifiers I want to display. With StoreKit 2, I can do this simply by calling a static method on the Product struct.  After I receive the products from the App Store, I want to separate them by type. I can do this easily with StoreKit 2 since the Product type now provides a property for the type as it's defined on the App Store server. In my app, I'm selling three types of products: fuel, cars, and a navigation package. Fuel is a consumable product -- once I use it, it's gone -- so I'll put all the consumables in to the fuel array.  Cars are a non-consumable. Once I purchase a car, I own it forever. So I'll put all the non-consumables into the cars array.  The navigation package is a subscription product with three levels of service. My customers can subscribe to one level of service at a time, and they are billed periodically. Also, they can upgrade or downgrade at any time if they want to change their level of service. The App Store will return a Product for each level of service, so I'll put all the auto-renewable subscriptions into the subscriptions array.  I also want to sort my products within each type by price, lowest to highest.  Let's run my app and check out what I've done so far.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Jeff Nadeau: Hi, and welcome to \"What's new in AppKit.\" I'm Jeff Nadeau. I work on AppKit, and I've got some great updates to share with you. macOS Monterey includes some great new features and enhancements for Mac apps. There's really something for everyone in this release, including updates to our user interface design, enhancements to many of our controls, a big update to SF Symbols, an all-new text engine called TextKit 2, powerful new Swift language features, and automation with Shortcuts, which is now available on the Mac. Let's dive right in, starting with some updates on the design of the macOS user interface. We're thrilled by the response to the system-wide redesign that debuted in macOS Big Sur. So many of our favorite apps have updated to adopt the new design in only a few short months. In macOS Monterey, we've continued to iterate and refine this new design, so you'll notice a few new touches across the system. Some of them are big and noticeable, like popovers that now appear and recede with a brand-new animation, or sliders that now smoothly glide into position when you click them. There are also much more subtle changes, like refined metrics in toolbar controls, and spring-loading support on the Search button, so it's easy to drag in text and tokens. And increased spacing between table sections to improve clarity. We've continued to iterate and enhance the new design down to the smallest details. And that leads me to some control enhancements that you can use to refine your own designs. The first big one is control tinting. We've enabled custom tinting of individual buttons, segmented controls, and sliders. Each of these controls accepts a custom tint color using one of these APIs: bezelColor, selectedSegmentColor, and trackFillColor. We introduced these APIs in macOS Sierra to allow tinting of individual controls in the Touch Bar. And starting in macOS Monterey, they're functional for in-window controls as well. To recap, most controls draw using the accent color, which is configurable in System Preferences. This allows people to theme their Mac to match their favorite color. The Multicolor option allows each app to define its own custom color. For pervasive theming, you can define a custom accent color in your app's asset catalog. The new tinting API provides a way to override the color for one specific control. This is great for controls where you'd like to apply a semantically meaningful color. For example, if your app uses a specific shade of orange to distinguish a preorder from a normal purchase, you can reinforce that design using a tinted button. Another example would be a video conferencing app, where the Start and End Call buttons perform two of the most meaningful actions in the app. Tinting them green and red adds emphasis and it makes their function instantly recognizable. One important note is that tinted buttons always show their tint color in every active state, unlike ordinary push buttons which are white or gray. This puts your tint color front and center. However, take care in your design not to create confusion with the default button, which also uses a colorful appearance. Finally, it's important to convey your controls' purpose using more than just color. You want to make sure that people who have difficultly distinguishing between colors can still easily identify the purpose of a given control, so be sure to provide a clear label or icon. Another important button design change is that push buttons no longer highlight using the accent color on click. This brings them in line with other clickable elements, like segmented control segments, slider knobs, and steppers. This is an important change, because if you're doing any custom drawing that assumes a colorful appearance while highlighted -- say, if you're choosing to draw white content over top -- it might not look correct on macOS Monterey. Instead of checking for the highlight state, you can drive your drawing decisions using the interiorBackgroundStyle property. This property reflects the underlying style of the button bezel, so it'll always return .normal for colorless states, and it'll return .emphasized for those colorful emphasis states, like tinted buttons, default buttons, and buttons that are toggled into an \"on\" state. Finally, we've updated the Flexible Push style of button -- previously known as Regular Square -- to serve as a variable-height push button. It now supports all of the same configurations as an ordinary push button, which means that it can serve as the default button, and you can tint it. The corner radius and content padding now match those of a standard push button at each control size, so they'll fit in great with your other controls, but their vertically resizable design means that they can accommodate larger icons or text with line breaks. While the vast majority of push buttons should continue to use the standard fixed-height style, this newly expanded style offers some flexibility for those special cases when you need to accommodate taller content. Another very important control update comes in the form of automatic localization for menu keyboard shortcuts. There are a lot of keyboard layouts out there in the world, and that can make localizing keyboard shortcuts fairly complex. Some key combinations are hard to reach on some keyboards, and others can't be typed at all. In addition, some directional keyboard shortcuts really ought to mirror in right-to-left languages. The great news is, in macOS Monterey, AppKit can do it for you. Here's an example of a shortcut that could benefit from localization: Command-backslash. While this works fine on a US English keyboard, it's actually impossible to type on a Japanese keyboard, which doesn't have a backslash key at all. Starting in macOS Monterey, the system remaps the shortcut automatically, providing an equivalent shortcut that's natural to type. Another common case is a keyboard shortcut that has directional meaning. For example, Safari uses Command-square brackets to go backward and forward in history. In a right-to-left language, using the left bracket to go backward isn't very intuitive, so AppKit now automatically swaps it to the right bracket when running in a right-to-left language. This behavior applies to brackets, braces, parentheses, and arrow keys. In some cases, you might want to disable this mirroring behavior. For example, if your menu item has absolute directionality -- like align left, for example -- you'd want to use the left bracket even in a right-to-left language. We've provided an opt-out for cases just like this. You can control this behavior using some new properties on NSMenuItem. allowsAutomaticKey EquivalentMirroring lets you control the mirroring behavior for directional keys like  brackets, and allowsAutomaticKey EquivalentLocalization controls all of the localization features, including keyboard mapping and mirroring. If you've already carefully localized your keyboard shortcuts, or if your application has a heavily custom implementation of keyboard shortcut bindings, you might want to disable this feature for your entire app. To do that, you can implement this application delegate method, applicationShouldAutomatically LocalizeKeyEquivalents, and return false. Most apps won't need to use this. The individual menu item APIs are strongly preferred for opting out specific items, and most apps shouldn't need to opt out at all. Next up, some big enhancements to symbol images. We brought SF Symbols to macOS in Big Sur, opening up a massive repertoire of beautiful, typographically balanced symbol images to all Mac apps. In macOS Monterey, we've built a new generation of symbol APIs and tooling that we call SF Symbols 3. It's a huge update that spans every aspect of the symbol image workflow, and it's all available to your AppKit applications. SF Symbols 3 expands the capabilities of the SF Symbols app for previewing, exporting, and importing symbol images. It also comes with an updated format for annotating custom symbols, which allows you to define distinct layers within a symbol image, and we've expanded our APIs in AppKit, UIKit, and SwiftUI to allow to you to individually color each layer of a symbol. In Big Sur, we offered two distinct rendering modes for symbols. First, there was the traditional Template style, which draws using a single tint color or effect over the entire symbol. The second is Multicolor, which draws more like a full-color image, drawing each path element using a color that's defined in the symbol image itself. In SF Symbols 3, we've added two new rendering modes which take advantage of the layer information provided by the new symbol image format. The first, Hierarchical, draws using a single color, while putting emphasis on specific parts of the symbol while deemphasizing others. And the second, Palette, lets you assign any color you'd like to each layer of the symbol. You can access these rendering modes using new API on NSImage.SymbolConfiguration. I'm representing the NSColor parameters as dots to show how they correspond with the rendered symbol. The Hierarchical rendering mode take a single color, which is applied to the symbol layers with decreasing opacity.

As more and more packages are being published, we want to make the discovery of packages that fit particular use cases more accessible. When adding packages to their project, developers would also like to see more information, such as their license. To do that, we want a standardized way of accessing metadata. This is why, in Xcode 13, we are introducing Package collections, curated lists of packages that can be shared with others and which drive a whole new and improved experience for adding packages to your projects. Educators and community influencers can publish package collections to go along with course materials or blog posts, removing the barriers when using packages for the first time, and the burden of deciding which packages are useful for a particular task. Enterprises can use collections to narrow down the decision space for their internal engineering teams, focusing them on a trusted set of vetted packages. First, a quick overview of the talk. We start with a demo, then see how to use collections in more detail. We'll dive into creating our own collections, and finish off with another demo. I found a blog post on Swift Numerics, and I'm eager to try it out in Xcode.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, I'm Harry, an engineer on the SwiftUI team. Welcome to \"Craft search experiences in SwiftUI.\" Search is all-new in SwiftUI this year, and I'm excited to show you how to start using these features. Sometimes, you want to find something specific within an app, but many apps contain large collections of data, which can make it difficult to find exactly what you're looking for. Whether it's finding the latest app trend, your next favorite song, or the right podcast for your morning commute, implementing search helps do just that. The best search experience will vary based on the structure and content of the app. But, in general, all experiences will include a search field that defines a search query. Now, you can implement search directly in SwiftUI. Let's take a look. In this talk, I'll introduce the new searchable modifier that forms the foundation of all search features in SwiftUI. I'll showcase how a navigation view integrates with the searchable modifier. Finally, I'll cover extending the functionality of searchable modifiers by adding search suggestions. Searchable is a new view modifier in SwiftUI available on all platforms. It allows you to mark view content as being, well, searchable. The content will define exactly what that means. Throughout this talk, I'll explore examples of this modifier on each platform. Now, to better understand this modifier, let's talk about the weather! A great example of search on iOS can be found in the new Weather app. When viewing your list of cities, you can start typing into the search bar, which will search for a new city to add to your list. To illustrate how Weather uses a searchable modifier to power this feature, let's break down the structure of their UI. Weather starts with a navigation view, which provides a navigation bar. Weather adds a custom list as the navigation view's content. And inside of that list, it adds a ForEach over its cells. Finally, Weather adds the searchable modifier to its navigation view. At the core of all searchable modifiers is the configuration of a search field. The searchable modifier takes the configured search field and passes that down, through the environment, for other views to use in the best way for each platform. Here, the navigation view understands that search field and will render it as a search bar. If no views use the configured search field, the searchable modifier provides a default implementation of rendering the search field in the toolbar. Now, a search field is often not the only piece of search-related UI. Displaying some form of search results is a common design pattern. Weather follows this pattern, and whenever it sees a non-empty search query, it switches its custom list to display another list containing the results of the current query. Let's see how Weather can use information vended by the searchable modifier to achieve this UI. Here's Weather's custom list. Searchable modifiers set up a new environment property, called isSearching, that Weather uses to dynamically change the view being displayed, based on whether a user is actively searching. Weather queries the isSearching environment property and the text of the search to conditionally show its results view. When rendering your own results, consider using an overlay so that the state of your main UI is unchanged after a user returns from their search interaction. Let's talk a little bit more about how a navigation view integrates with the new searchable modifier. To do that, I'd like to introduce an app I've been working tirelessly on. I call it Colors. This app lets users manage a library of their favorite sets of colors, called Palettes. Maybe you wanna play with different paints for your room, themes for your app, or just get help picking the color of your new M1 iMac. No matter your desire, Colors is the app for you. The basic structure of Colors is a double-column navigation view, where the first column, the root view, is a sidebar on iPadOS and macOS, or the root of a navigation stack on other platforms. In the sidebar, you can see my library of color palettes. In the detail view, you can see the currently selected color palette, as well as how those colors might appear to users with visual differences. As people started using the app, I began to notice something. People love colors. They're adding colors to their library constantly, but as a library gets large, it becomes difficult to find a specific color palette, as people have to scroll through their whole library to find it. At this point, I've decided it’s time to add search functionality. I'd like this feature to follow platform conventions so that people using my app immediately understand it. Let's take a look at how I can use the searchable modifier to implement this feature.",

Hi my name is Adam Humphrey, and here at Apple I'm on a team that works with enterprise companies all around the world to help them create great custom apps for their employees. And today I'm happy to share some of our knowledge to help you do the same. Apps have changed the way we live our lives. People now expect the same change at work. At Apple, we believe employees should have access to apps that allow them to do their best work and fundamentally improve how things get done. So let's begin. I'll start by describing some of the characteristics that are unique to enterprise apps. Then I'll talk about how to find opportunities in employee roles that are best served by custom apps. And next I'll talk about the importance of not just including your employees in the design and development process but enabling them to drive it. And finally I'll talk about the tools Apple has developed to help you build custom apps quickly, get them in the hands of your employees and continuously improve with their feedback. All right, so let's dive right in. First let me talk about some of the characteristics of an enterprise app. Simply stated, enterprise apps are employee facing and these apps are as unique as the employees who use them. Another characteristic is that many of them aren't found in the public App store. Enterprise apps are mostly distributed internally by the enterprises themselves using MDM and Apple business manager. Some enterprise apps are used by a lot of employees. Like this, company directory app which allows you to easily search for your colleagues see their availability and quickly connect with them. Or this conference room app that can find the closest available conference room and allows you to book it with just one tap. Some are role-based, tailored to very discreet groups of employees.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Jeff Robertson: Welcome to the second part of our talk on building a great Mac app in SwiftUI. I'm Jeff, an engineer on the SwiftUI team. I hope you enjoyed the first part of this talk by my colleague Mathieu. If you have not yet watched part one, please stop here and do so now, as we will be building on top of the changes that are discussed in that talk. Our gardening app has come a long way since the start of Mathieu's talk. SwiftUI enabled us to build an app with quite a bit of functionality in very little time. However, users tend to use our apps in many different ways, and a particularly great macOS app will account for this. With that in mind, let's take a look at some of the ways that we can build an app for everyone while still maintaining the principles Mathieu outlined in part one. First, we'll take a look at what it means to be a fully customizable macOS app, by handling changes to the system as a whole as well as within our own app. Adding an additional workflow for our users to manipulate their data through drag and drop is another way for us to provide a flexible user experience. Then, we'll explore how to work with the file system, by allowing our app's data to be exported. And finally, we'll add support for Continuity Camera to create a seamless workflow for importing images into our app. The first thing I'd like to talk to you about isn't any specific API at all, but more about how an app built with SwiftUI fits in with the customizability of macOS. Here, I have our gardening app open as well as System Preferences. I'm going to switch to Dark mode, and you can see our app updates its interface automatically. While I have the System Preferences open, I'm also going to update my sidebar icon size to be large. Just as with Dark mode, our app adjusted itself to what I set in System Preferences. I love these little touches, both as a developer -- since I get them automatically -- and as a user -- since it means the apps I'm using will be taking into account my own personal tastes. Before I leave System Preferences to focus on our app, I'd like to point out that I have my accent color set to be multicolor. This feature allows developers to configure an app-specific accent color; and the operating system will customize your app's buttons, selection highlighting, and sidebar glyphs. I'd like to support an accent color in my app, so I'm going to open the asset catalog in our project and select the AccentColor. And I'm going to change its content to be system green to match our app's theme. As you can see, our sidebar icons and selection have all picked up the change. We've seen how our app can automatically react to changes which affect the entire operating system, but what about app-specific settings? Let's walk through adding an interface to let users customize our gardening app. Here, I've opened our GardenApp file. And alongside the WindowGroup scene I'm going to add a Settings scene. And this scene will give us a menu item which, when selected, will open a window with our view. I'm going to use the SettingsView that I've set up, and I'm going to pass it my model as well.  Additionally, the Settings scene will also add the appropriate menu item to your app's main menu and configure it with the standard keyboard shortcut of Command-comma. This gives us a great start. Now, let's take a look at the SettingsView, where I'll define the interface. On macOS, it's common for apps to provide a settings interface with toolbar icons to allow switching between the different panes, particularly if the app provides a lot of settings which can be divided up into different categories. So for my main view here, I'm going to use a TabView.  And I'm going to give it two children: one for GeneralSettings, and one for ViewingSettings. And for the content of the tab in the window toolbar area, I'm going to use a tabItem. And the contents of this can just be a Label. We'll give it the text to be displayed -- in this case, \"General\" -- and a systemImage; I'm going to use \"gear\" for GeneralSettings. And then let's do the same for our ViewingSettings. I'll add a tabItem and a Label -- we'll call it \"Viewing\" -- and a systemImage of, I think, \"eyeglasses.\" All right. So now we have the contents of our two tabs. Let's fill out the GeneralSettings now. Something that could be nice for our users is the ability to define a garden to be used as the default when no garden is currently selected. For this, I'm going to add a Picker...  And the first item, I think, will be the Text(\"None\"). And for the others, I'm going to add a ForEach over all the gardens in our data.  And for each garden, I'm just going to add a Text and give it the garden's name as well as its displayYear. We'll also need to provide a tag here with the ID of the garden. So for our \"None\" value, we can give it a tag of none.  And for our other gardens, we'll give it a tag corresponding to the garden's ID.  Lastly, we need to provide some state for the Picker's selection. When providing a settings interface like this, it's important to persist the state so that your app remembers the user's selection across launches and OS updates. In SwiftUI, this can be accomplished by using the AppStorage property wrapper. This property wrapper will persist our value using the UserDefaults system, which is exactly what we want here. So for our selection binding, I'm going to add the AppStorage property wrapper. This takes a key. We'll give it \"defaultGarden\", and we'll call it \"selection\". It is also an optional Garden.ID. And what this will do is persist our selection value using the user default system. I'm also going to add a fixedSize to my Picker and some padding to the form.  I'm going to switch over to our ContentView here, and I'll add our AppStorage and give it that same key we used.  We'll call it \"defaultGardenID\", and it's also an optional Garden.ID. And then here where I have this binding for selection, I'm going to replace this with a Binding, and the \"get\" will be to first use the selectedGardenID. And then if that isn't set, we're going to fall back to the defaultGardenID. And then for the setter, we only want to update our selectedGardenID. We don't actually want to update our defaultGarden. So I'm just going to say \"selectedGardenID = $0\". All right. I'm going to run our app. Open the Preferences menu item here, and I'm going to select Indoor Plants as my default garden. And I'll open a new window, and we see Indoor Plants is selected. Providing customization support via settings is one nice way of building a flexible experience for our users. Another way is providing alternative workflows for the same action. In the first part of our talk, Mathieu showed you how to add a main menu item for adding a plant to the selected garden. This is great functionality for our app, but let's look at another way that we can provide similar functionality via a common macOS user interaction: drag and drop. Since we're using table here, I'm going to make a couple of adjustments to support it being a drag source and drop destination. The first thing I'm going to do is remove this \"plants\" from the initializer. Then I'm going to go down at the end and add a row builder. For the contents of this row builder, I'm going to add a ForEach and use those plants that we had from before.  And for each plant, I'm just going to create a TableRow with it. So now I'm going to customize each of our TableRows by adding the itemProvider modifier. And I'm going to return just plant.itemProvider here, which is a computed property I set up on my model. So now each of these rows supports being a drag source. I've made enough changes now to allow me to drag out my plants, but this is not very useful if nothing will accept it. Let's fix that by also adding drop support to our table. The onInsert modifier is the other half of our drag and drop equation. It takes a list of content types, and I'm going to pass Plant.draggableType here, which is a custom type I set up on my model. It also takes a closure, which is passed two parameters. One is the index where the drop occurred, and another is the list of item providers. We're going to then call Plant.fromItemProviders to create our model, and we'll pass those item providers here. This will give us back a list of plants, which we can use to update our model. I'll call garden.plants.insert (contentsOf: plants) at the index where it occurred.",

The goal is for your users to feel as if they were physically together, wherever they may be. The GroupActivities API is a Swift framework for creating shared experiences. It takes care of coordinating media for you, via APIs for playback coordination and group session management. And it is supported across a wide range of Apple platforms, such as iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. Let's start off with a demo of the GroupActivities API, by calling my colleague, Moritz, and sharing a video from the sample app attached to this talk. Let's see if Moritz is available.  Hi, Moritz! Hey, Hayden! I'm gonna home out and open the sample app. You can see it's a list of drone footage from Apple Park. I'm gonna show the theater footage to Moritz. How does that look, Moritz? Do you wanna watch it? That looks great. I really love that one. But did you see the new one I uploaded last week from the rings? Oh, it looks great! I'm gonna start playback, and our videos will be in sync across our devices. You can see if I pause, it'll also pause for Moritz. And if he moves ahead, it'll also move ahead for me.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Nikhil Palekar: Hi, I’m Nikhil, and I’m an engineer on the CloudKit team. Today, I’m excited to introduce you to CloudKit Console. iCloud is an incredibly powerful service for expanding the capability of your users’ devices to the cloud. Millions of people use iCloud to store their photos, files, and data securely. CloudKit, the database behind iCloud, can efficiently and seamlessly synchronize content across devices for a magical experience. And being cloud-based, CloudKit services are managed online through developer.apple.com. Today, I’m excited to show you CloudKit Console, a redesigned set of dashboard tools that help you manage how your applications interact with CloudKit services. In the Console, you can access and manage CloudKit database and view telemetry and logs in a fresh new interface that makes it easier than ever to get things done. Throughout the Console, the content follows the same familiar structure that you're used to with other Apple applications: context and account information on the top, navigation and properties on the left, and details in the middle. From this new layout, you can easily select a feature, then dive deeper into the details. Let’s start by looking at a few features in the new Database app. In case you're new to CloudKit database, the short story is that CloudKit databases exist within a container defined for your use case, and developers use two database environments: development and production. Database schemas are promoted from development to production once the app developer is comfortable with the changes they made during development. As you’re getting started, you can iterate quickly on development databases using just-in-time schema creation or by defining your data model in the Console. When you're ready, you can deploy the schema to production and CloudKit will verify the integrity of the updates to avoid breaking older clients of your database. As I launch the Database app, I can see a list of containers owned by my developer team. The next time I launch the Console, it will bring me straight to the last container I visited. I’ve selected the Development environment in the dropdown, and now let’s look at the Schema section to explore how record types are defined. Record types are used to define data structures in CloudKit database. I can quickly view the list of existing record types, and then click to see details on the fields and indexes. Adding a field is simple. I just provide a name for my new field, and choose its corresponding type.",

Here's how search looks in our TV app. We've increased the size of the text in the search field, so it's easy to see what you've typed. And in many languages we've optimized the keyboard layout to one line. That leaves more space for your search results. Some apps like our Music app take advantage of our new search suggestions feature. These suggestions allow you to minimize typing and find what you're looking for even faster. If you're already using UISearchController, you get most of what you've seen here for free. For those of you that aren't, let's review how simple it is to add to your app. Let me show you. We have a simple tab-based app here with photos and videos from travel over the years. As a reminder, tvOS apps work best with a NavigationController as the root view controller that contains a UITabBarController. Let's head to Xcode and look at adding search UI to our app.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Garrett Davidson: Hi, I’m Garrett, an engineer on the Authentication Experience team, and I'm very excited to give you a peek into what we’ve been working on: the first step Apple is taking to support the industry-wide transition away from passwords. Every time you sign in to an app or website today, you’re probably entering a password. The iconic User name and Password field pair is instantly recognizable and really easy to use, and most people immediately know what to do when they encounter it. But developers, users, and the industry as whole have collectively learned that this great convenience of being able to quickly authenticate to sign in to an account comes at a cost to account security. As authentication technologies have evolved over the years, there are a few fundamental lessons that the industry has learned. First off, protecting secrets is hard, especially when those secrets are shared. Most authentication today relies on the user and server sharing a secret -- like a password -- when the account is created, and resharing that secret during every authentication. Each time that secret is shared, there’s a risk that someone other than the intended recipient learns that secret. Phishing -- such as fake emails and phone calls or misleading websites -- is the most common way for the wrong party to learn a secret. And if a secret like a password does get out, using weak passwords or reusing the same password across multiple accounts can quickly compound the problem. In fact, according to the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report, more than 80 percent of hacking-related data breaches involved the brute force of credentials or using lost or stolen credentials. It doesn’t have to be this way. Authentication technology has continued to evolve to try to mitigate some of these risks. At first, passwords were mostly stored in people’s heads. But it turns out that people generally aren’t good at coming up with and remembering strong and unique passwords for every account. Password managers can create strong, unique passwords per account, and can provide hints about some forms of possible phishing. iCloud Keychain’s password manager is built in to your Apple devices, and we’ve made APIs available for third parties to integrate their own password managers into the system. Service owners can also add additional steps to the login flow, such as requiring a password plus an additional factor like an OTP; for instance, an SMS or a generated one-time verification code. macOS Monterey and iOS 15 even have a code generator built in to the iCloud Keychain password manager, which you can learn more about in the “Secure login with iCloud Keychain verification codes” video from my teammate Eryn. Some apps and websites alternatively choose to outsource authentication entirely to a third party through federated authentication, such as Sign in with Apple. Federated authentication lets people keep their trust confined to a small number of highly protected accounts. But for this video, I’m going to be focusing on nonfederated authentication options. Let’s talk about how these compare. They’re all pretty easy to use, they all work on most devices, and they’re more or less always with you. But the security level could be better. Passwords that can be remembered probably aren’t strong and unique for every account. A password manager can be used to create strong and unique passwords, but it is only as strong as the password -- and potentially additional factors -- that you use to protect it. And single-use codes can also help but are still subject to many of the same problems as passwords, since they’re still typeable, phishable, shared secrets. Also, if passwords are in your head, you can forget them. This means apps and websites need a separate recovery flow, which today is usually a link in an email. This can reduce the entire account’s security level to the level of security of the email provider, which is generally not something you control. Some password managers and second-factor solutions can help with recovery but tend to face similar problems. Remembered passwords also don’t offer any kind of phishing resistance. Password managers can provide hints about phishing -- such as not offering to fill a password on a phishing site that looks otherwise legitimate -- but they still can’t prevent someone from manually entering the password themselves and getting phished. One-time codes have similar problems, though there are some modern mitigations you can put in place. And finally, all of these methods rely on a shared secret between the user and a server, making them fundamentally no stronger than the weakest protection of that shared secret. With that chart in mind, let’s talk about the properties of an actual solution to the password problem. First off, a replacement for passwords needs to be secure by design. Passwords can be reasonably secure, if all of the best practices are followed. However, experience has shown us that that’s pretty hard for everyone to do all of the time. A replacement for passwords should build that security in from the beginning. But we don’t want to go backwards in usability either. Passwords have been with us for so long because they’re so easy to use. We don’t want to lose that. Being easy includes always being available and being usable everywhere. Today, as long as I know or can look up my password, I can pretty much assume that the device I want to sign into supports it. Any additional friction to authenticating on new devices is going to hurt adoption from people who just want to quickly get signed in. And finally, recovery should be a first-class feature not something that gets added as an afterthought. People make mistakes, bad things happen, and a solution to passwords should be fault tolerant enough to handle humans being human without compromising the overall security. One of the strongest security options out there today is security keys, the hardware dongles or fobs that are generally used as a second factor in especially high security contexts. They are based on the web authentication -- or WebAuthn -- standard, which is open to everyone. And most of them are pretty easy to use after the initial learning curve. And they’re way more secure than just a password. Most of this strength comes from WebAuthn, which I’ll talk about more in a bit. Modern web browsers also support security keys on most modern devices. Safari on macOS and iOS has supported USB, NFC, and Lightning security keys for a while. Most security keys also support more than one connection method, so a single hardware key can be used on many different devices. Let’s compare WebAuthn and passwords. One of the biggest advantages of WebAuthn is it uses public/private key pairs instead of shared secrets. If we examine how passwords work today, first you enter your password. Then, it’s usually obfuscated through something like hashing plus salting, and the resulting salted hash is sent to the server. Now, both you and the server have a copy of the secret, even though the server’s copy is obfuscated, and you’re both equally responsible for protecting that secret. This is what we’re getting rid of. With public/private key pairs, instead of a password, your device creates a pair of keys. One of these keys is public; just as public as your username. It can be shared with anyone and everyone, and is not a secret. The other key is private. This private key is a secret and is protected by your device. Your device never shares this key with anyone else, not even the server. When you create an account, your device generates these two associated keys. It then shares the public key with the server. Now, the server has a copy of the public key, which does not have the same protection requirements as a password because it’s public information. The private key stays on your device, and only that device is responsible for protecting it. Later, when you want to sign in, you don’t send the server anything secret. Instead you prove that it’s your account by proving that your device knows the private key associated with your account’s public key. That exchange works like this. First, I go to sign in to my account. Then, the website asks my device to prove that it’s actually my account. It does this by performing what’s called a \"challenge\" for me to prove that my device has the private key associated with my account’s public key without actually saying what my private key is. To do so, the server sends back a single-use challenge. My device has the private key, so it takes that challenge and does something called “signing” of the challenge, using my private key. Only my private key can produce a valid signature for my account. This signature then gets sent back to the server. The server already has my public key, so it can check this signature against that public key. Anyone who has my public key can easily check if a signature matches that key. However, only I can create a valid signature for the challenge because only I have the private key. Therefore, anyone can easily verify my identity without ever learning what my secret is. And finally, assuming the signature does actually match my public key, the server tells me I’m signed in! Notice that my private key never left my device. The server was able to verify that this is my account without ever learning what my secret -- my private key -- actually is.",

I've been helping several third-party developers to optimize their GPU and CPU workloads on Apple platforms. With the help of the CoreOS team, I gathered here information and guidelines to achieve better CPU performance and efficiency in games. We are focusing on games, because they are usually highly demanding in terms of hardware resources. Also, their typical workload requires hundreds, if not thousands, of CPU jobs to be processed every frame. To get those done in 16 milliseconds or less, jobs must be tailored for maximum CPU throughput, and their submission overhead must be minimized. First, I'll go through an overview of the Apple silicon CPU and its unique architecture. Then, I'll provide you with fundamental guidance on how to organize your work to maximize the CPU efficiency. Finally, we'll discuss useful APIs to leverage, once those guidelines are implemented. Let's get started with the Apple CPU architecture. Apple has been designing its own chips for more than a decade. They are at the core of Apple devices. Apple silicon offers high performance and unmatched efficiency. Last year, Apple introduced the M1 chip. That was the first Apple silicon chip to be made available to Mac computers. And this year... ...we introduced M1 Pro, and M1 Max. Their new design is a huge leap for Apple silicon and makes them able to efficiently tackle very demanding workloads. The M1 chip gathers in a single package many components.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Kyle Macomber: Hi, I'm Kyle. The Swift Standard Library team maintains a growing roster of open-source packages including Swift ArgumentParser, Swift Numerics, and Swift System. Today, we're excited to introduce two big new additions to the family: Swift Algorithms and Swift Collections! Swift Algorithms is an open-source package of sequence and collection algorithms that augments the Swift standard library. One of the most powerful features of Swift is the rich taxonomy of algorithms that come built in. It takes a little investment to learn the vocabulary, but once you do, it can be striking to discover just how many algorithms are hiding in plain sight and how much you can improve the quality of your code by adopting them. To see what I mean, let's take a look at some code from a messaging application that I've been working on. Consider this loop which iterates over the index paths for the selected rows in a table view, collecting all the corresponding messages for forwarding or deletion. This is just a map. Using map makes this code clearer to the reader because it provides extra context that the body of the closure, regardless of its length or complexity, is just transforming the input. Using map also makes this code faster because it avoids intermediate allocations due to array resizing by reserving capacity -- something our raw loop wasn't bothering to do. Or consider this loop which, if the user taps on an image, iterates the messages in the transcript, collecting all the attachments for display using Quick Look. This is just a map and a filter! In fact, this pattern of filtering out nils and mapping to unwrap optionals is so common that we have a special name and algorithm for it: compactMap. Next, consider this code. I have an array of messages, and I want to transform it into an array of transcript items. The tricky thing is that any given message might correspond to multiple items in the chat transcript. Using map here produces an array of arrays. But that's not what I want; I just want a flat array. Does this mean I have to go back to using a raw for loop? Of course not; we've got another algorithm for that. It's called \"joined\". What it does is join together all the inner arrays into a single, flat collection of elements. This pattern of mapping and joining is so common that we define another special kind of map for it: flatMap. Of course, map and filter are just the tip of the iceberg. Consider this raw loop from the chat detail screen in my app. I want to display the last six photos in a chat, from newest to oldest. So I iterate the transcript in reverse -- from newest to oldest -- and if the item is a photo, I add it to the array. And once I have six, I stop. We can express this more concisely by chaining together algorithms from the standard library -- reversed, compactMap, and prefix -- to take no more than the first six. Chaining together algorithms also gives us more flexibility to express this code more clearly. For example, I find it more natural to think about this operation in terms of the suffix of the transcript rather than the prefix of the reversed transcript. So the chain of algorithms is clearer and more concise than the raw loop, but how does the performance compare? If each step in the chain allocates an intermediate array, isn't it going to be slower than the raw loop? The answer would be yes if the standard library weren't playing some clever tricks here. Let's return to the joined algorithm we saw earlier to take a closer look at what's going on. It turns out joined doesn't actually allocate and return a new array here. Instead, it returns a FlattenSequence. FlattenSequence is what we call a \"lazy adapter\". For most purposes, it works like an array, but it's just a thin wrapper, so it's effectively free to create. And it's lazy, so it processes its elements on demand, rather than doing all the work up front. Lazy adapters like FlattenSequence are what enable algorithm chains to have competitive performance with raw for loops. Let's return to the detail screen and take a closer look at our algorithm to compute the last six photos in a chat. We see that suffix actually just returns an array slice -- that's clever -- and that reversed is also implemented as a lazy adapter, one which intercedes to start at the end and end at the start. What about compactMap? It's still returning an array. Can that be lazy? It can. You just have to add a .lazy to the start of the chain, and it makes any of the algorithms that take a closure, like map and filter, lazy! Lazy algorithm chains are a great fit for use cases like this one, where you're only processing a small number of elements from a potentially very large collection. Of course, sometimes you do need or want an array. And in that case, you can always just wrap your algorithm chain in an array initializer. This is one more reason why, on the Standard Library team, we're a big fan of lazy algorithms. It's really easy to turn a lazy algorithm into an eager result, but it's impossible to go the other way. So I've been making great progress on my messaging app, and my designer approaches me with a feature request. They'd like to include time stamps in the transcript, if more than an hour has passed between any two consecutive messages. Seems reasonable. There's got to be another algorithm I can use for this, right? There is. But to access it, I'm going to need to import the Swift Algorithms package. Every once in a while, you're going to encounter use cases like these that the Swift standard library doesn't have coverage for yet. The purpose of the Algorithms package is to provide a low-friction venue for us -- with your help -- to incubate new families of missing algorithms for eventual inclusion in the standard library. We've already added over 40 algorithms to Swift Algorithms. For things like generating all the combinations or permutations of a collection of elements; or iterating the elements of a sequence by two or three or in groups determined by a predicate; or selecting the five smallest elements in a collection, the five largest, or just any five at random. Let's take a closer look at some of the powerful iteration tools that come with Swift Algorithms. windows(ofCount:) provides a sliding window, here of size 3, into the elements of a collection. For each turn of the loop, window is just a subsequence of the base collection -- here an ArraySlice -- which avoids any intermediate allocation. windows(ofCount: 2) are particularly common and so we have a convenience for it. It's called \"adjacentPairs\". adjacentPairs vends a tuple rather than a subsequence, allowing for more convenient element access. Another powerful iteration tool is chunks(ofCount:). Unlike windows, chunks don't overlap. If a collection isn't evenly divisible by the chunk count, the last chunk in the sequence will contain the remainder. And just like windows, chunks are subsequences of the base collection, so they're cheap to create. Sometimes you want to chunk a collection into runs of like-elements. Here we're chunking on isPrime. This means we'll iterate the chunks of consecutive elements that return the same value for isPrime. For convenience, chunked(on:) vends a tuple of both the chunk and the value being chunked on. Have you ever found yourself writing a raw loop like this one that only does some work if the previous and current elements differ? This is just chunked! Let's return now to that feature request from my designer to include time stamps in the transcript whenever more than an hour has passed between messages. If you recall, we create the transcript by flat mapping over the messages to make the transcript items. Well, every transcript item has access to its date. We can chunk on the date to group transcript items together if less than an hour has passed between them. We've already seen how to chunk a collection into runs of like elements. Swift Algorithms comes with another variant of chunked that allows you to provide a custom predicate. It passes you adjacent pairs of elements, and you return true if they belong in the same group. Here, we return true if the time interval between transcript items is less than an hour. Next, we need to create the time stamps and join everything together into a single, flat collection. Earlier, we used joined to flatten a nested collection. The standard library comes with another variant of joined that can insert a separator. It's really common to use this algorithm to join together strings with, say, a new line or a comma separator. However, in this case, a constant separator isn't sufficient. We need access to the first date in the next chunk in order to construct the time stamp. Well, the Algorithms package includes another variant of joined that lets you compute the separator from the previous and next chunks. We can use that here to join back together the chunks of transcript items, now separated by time stamps. Pretty satisfying, huh? Of course, we don't need to be paying for any of these intermediate allocations. All of this can be computed on demand just by adding a .lazy. Voilà! I want to caution, though, that laziness is not a silver bullet. When you're only iterating a sequence a single time, computing on demand can save work and avoid allocations. But when you're iterating a sequence again and again -- like I am with the transcript in my messaging app -- computing on demand will repeat the same work over and over -- mapping, chunking, and joining every time the user enters edit mode, taps on an image, or visits the detail screen. In cases like this, you should still use a lazy algorithm chain. It's just that as a last step, it'll be more efficient if you save your work by collecting everything together into an array. We've looked at over a dozen different algorithms from the Swift standard library and the Algorithms package. All of them work not only on array, but also string, and every other Swift type that conforms to the sequence and collection protocols -- including every data structure in the new Swift Collections package. Chaining together algorithms makes your code clearer, faster, and more correct. And becoming proficient at it isn't complicated; it's just about building your vocabulary. So next time you find yourself reading or writing a raw loop, stop and think about if it's a map, a filter, or one of the other algorithms you've just seen. If nothing comes to mind, search the documentation on the sequence and collection protocols, or read the guides in the Swift Algorithms GitHub repository, or visit us on the Swift forums where we can figure it out together. Who knows, it might serve as the inspiration for a new addition to the Algorithms package! Next up, Karoy will teach you about the versatile data structures that come with the new Swift Collections package. Karoy? Karoy Lorentey: Thanks, Kyle! Let's talk about data structures. As it stands today, the Swift standard library implements just three major general-purpose data structures: it provides arrays, unordered sets, and unordered dictionaries. These have proved great choices as universal collection types, and they're especially nice for transferring data across module boundaries. They all implement copy-on-write value semantics, providing efficient in-place mutation operations while also ensuring that collection values are safe to pass around without these mutations leading to unexpected changes in any of the copies created. However, there are so many more data structures out there. It would be useful to have a larger selection to choose from. Earlier this year, we released the Swift Collections package, with new data structure implementations. This package lets Swift developers gain real-life production experience with new collection types before we eventually propose them for inclusion in the Swift standard library. By importing the Swift Collections package, we get access to additional types. The initial version of the package implements three of the most frequently requested data structures. These happen to be new variations of the three standard collection types. We have a double-ended queue, an OrderedSet, and an OrderedDictionary. These are similar to array, set, and dictionary; they are variants of the same theme, adding new features to the existing constructs. That said, these new types aren't replacements for the existing ones; they are complementary to them. For some use cases, the new types will be a better fit. However, for many others, the existing types continue to be the right choice. In order to know which data structure to reach for, we need to learn how these differ from the existing types. So let's take a brief look at each of these, starting with double-ended queues -- or, rather, queues in general. Queues pop up everywhere where an arbitrary number of items need to be processed one by one, from customers waiting in line in a supermarket to asynchronous tasks in an application. In their most abstract form, queues provide two major operations: we can push items to the back of the queue, and we can pop elements off the front.",

    "video_transcript": "Welcome to Introducing Extensible Enterprise Single Sign-On. My name is Matt Chanda. I am a consulting engineer and part of the team that created single sign-on. In this video I will provide you an overview of single sign-on, discuss how to create extensions, how to use them in your apps, how to deploy them, and finish up with best practices. As you know, almost all enterprise apps and websites need to authenticate in order to function. These apps connect the systems of record, either in the cloud, on premise, or both. Recently though, authentication has been getting more complicated. We need to consider multiple authentication methods including OpenID Connect, Kerberos, and SAML. We now have cloud resources that need to federate authentication to on-premise systems. We also have to trust our devices more, and sometimes we don't have passwords. How do organizations deal with these challenges? They use single sign-on to help. Single sign-on enables a suite of apps or web sites to seamlessly authenticate using the same credential. This results in a better user experience. Some enterprises do not have passwords, so they must use single sign-on. The problem is that not every app supports their needs. The existing authentication solutions can cause a lot of user friction. They have multiple pop-ups, repeated prompts, and bouncing between apps. There just hasn't been a way to have true single sign-on that is both secure and user friendly. Today I'd like to tell you about the powerful new single sign-on capabilities we added to iOS 13, iPadOS, and macOS Catalina. It's enabled by deploying the new extensible SSO MDM profile and associated domains. It works with user enrollment too. The extension can choose to present a UI, load a web page, or handle the request silently. We think these changes will enable you to make and use SSO solutions that are both user-friendly and secure. The new extensions will run on iOS, iPadOS and macOS. They enable both native apps and Safari to authenticate with your identity provider. The extensions are native code. They can enable multi-factor auth, access the keychain, use secure enclave generated keys, and more. They can leverage managed-app config and even use per-app VPN. You may be wondering about Sign in with Apple. Single sign-on is different than Sign in with Apple. Sign in with Apple is intended for your consumer apps and addresses different problems. First, it is meant to solve an account provisioning problem. Instead of making a new account everywhere, just use your Apple ID instead. It also solves a privacy problem where a site doesn’t need all your personal information. On the other hand, single sign-on enables you to use an existing enterprise account for your apps that require them. Your enterprise apps need to know exactly who you are and what you're allowed to do. Now that we have introduced it, you may be curious about what it actually looks like to do single sign-on. Let's take a look. On iOS, let's start by loading a web page that requires authentication. The extension will prompt me for credentials. I'll enter my username...",

This past year has seen unprecedented changes in the way we work, live, and learn. From the office to the kitchen table to the living room sofa, Apple hardware, software, and services have been there to give people the power and flexibility to do whatever needs doing. Apple platforms provide a huge opportunity for system administrators and mobile device management developers to deliver incredible apps, rich content, and powerful services to customers, employees, students, and teachers. At Apple, we believe that the balance between privacy, user agency, and administrative control is what makes for a great device management solution. And in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, we're introducing a number of great new features across all of our platforms. With so many exciting new features to share, we've created deep dive sessions for many of them. I'd like to briefly touch on a few topics before we get into today's content, starting with changes to user enrollment. User enrollment is designed for Bring Your Own Device deployments, where the user and not the organization owns the device. This MDM enrollment type protects the privacy of personal data while still securing corporate data on the device. This year, we have some exciting improvements to data separation and user onboarding. Check out the \"Discover account-driven user enrollment\" session to learn more. Next, I'm very excited to share with you that Apple Configurator for iPhone is coming to the App Store, and we have a new feature for macOS automated device enrollment. You are not going to want to miss the \"Manage devices with Apple configurator\" session. We're enhancing the device management protocol to be more robust and performant. For a look into the future of MDM, check out the \"Meet declarative device management\" session. This year, we have a number of exciting software update changes for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. See what's new in the \"Manage software updates in your organization\" session, where we'll discuss testing, deploying, and enforcing OS updates.

We'll also show you how a DataFrame can be used to drive all the data-centric features of your app.",
    "video_resources": "[]",
    "video_resources-href": "",
    "video_transcript": "Alejandro Isaza: Hi. I'm Alejandro. Today David and I will introduce TabularData, a new framework for data manipulation and exploration. I'll start with a quick introduction and then we'll talk about data exploration, data transformations, best practices, and end with a recap. Let's jump in. First let me talk about, what is tabular data? In the simplest terms, tabular data is data that is organized in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. But imagine you had hundreds of columns and millions of rows. This is where the TabularData framework comes in. So what is it? It is a brand-new framework we've been working on. It's already available in macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It will help you explore and manipulate unstructured data. When I say \"unstructured data\", I mean data that has not been arranged in a predefined manner. For example, when you download a dataset that doesn't have a technical specification; say, weather data or population statistics. And exploration is the first thing you do when you encounter a new dataset. You want to know what sort of information is there. Things like, what are the values? What are the types? How is the data represented? Are there missing values? And so on. You need to be able to answer these questions to properly understand a dataset and to be able to move to the next step, which is manipulation. Manipulation is where you transform the dataset into a form that is best suited for the problem you are trying to solve. For example, you may want to represent dates as a date type instead of a string, or you may want to combine x and y coordinates into a point type, and so on. The TabularData framework is great for dealing with large datasets. Here are some common use cases. Grouping data according to some criteria; for example, grouping people by age. Joining datasets on common values. For example, joining a table of transactions with the purchaser's information. Splitting or segmenting data for processing incrementally or filtering to a subset of the whole dataset. And building data pipelines; for instance, when doing feature engineering for machine learning. In the context of the framework, a table is known as a DataFrame. A DataFrame contains rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. But unlike a spreadsheet, every column can contain only a specific type of value. But this also means that columns can hold any type, even your own custom types. For example, dictionaries, GPS coordinates, or raw audio samples. Know that whenever we show a table representing a DataFrame, or a DataFrame slice, we include an index column on the left. This is relevant for when you need to access rows by data index. Some operations like filter, the data is unchanged, while other operations like sort may change the indices on the resulting data frame. Let's break it down and zoom in on a column. As I mentioned, a column has a specific element type; in this case, Int. It also has a name that must be unique in the data frame. A column is represented by the Column type, which is a collection, just like array. You can refer to a column by name but in most cases, you need the type as well. There is a struct called ColumnID that holds the name and type of a column, and can be used to refer to a specific column. Whenever possible, I recommend using predefined ColumnIDs over string literals to refer to columns. Also note that all columns in a DataFrame must have the same number of elements. But there can always be missing elements, represented as nil values. Similar to Column, there is a Row type. You can access each element of a row by column name or by index. You can think of Row as a proxy. It doesn't actually contain the elements in the row; instead, it's a reference pointing back to a row in the DataFrame. So how do you create a DataFrame? Let me show you. You can create a DataFrame from a dictionary literal or by building one column at a time. This is an example of building from a dictionary literal. Note that when using a dictionary literal, you are constrained to using basic Swift types such as strings, numbers, boolean values, and dates. Also keep in mind that every column must have the same number of elements. A more general way of building a DataFrame is to build one column at a time and then append the columns to the DataFrame. Here's an example. First, I create an empty DataFrame. Then I create a Column. And then I append the column to the DataFrame. I can repeat the process for all the columns, but again, make sure that every column has the same number of elements and that column names are unique. Now that you know what a DataFrame is, let's do some data exploration. The first thing you want to do is load a dataset. TabularData supports reading comma-separated values, CSV, and JSON files. And it's as simple as calling the initializer with a file URL, which will load using all default options. Let's explore some of the options available when loading a CSV. If you have used CSV before, you may know that there are not always commas. The separator may be a tab or a semicolon. Or there may or may not be a header row with the column names. There are also variations of how strings are escaped for special characters and how missing values are represented. TabularData can handle all the variations. In this example, I am specifying that there is no header row, using a custom nil encoding, ignoring empty lines, and using a semicolon delimiter. Please refer to the documentation to see the full set of options as well as the defaults. If you have a larger file, you may want to load only a subset of rows at a time. You can do this with the rows option. For example, this will only load the first 100 rows. Similarly, you can select a subset of the columns. To do this, use the columns argument. Note that this will also let you reorganize the columns.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Itai Rom: Welcome to \"Customize your advanced Xcode Cloud workflows.\" My name is Itai, and I'll be joined later by my colleague, Yan. This year we're introducing Xcode Cloud. Xcode Cloud is a continuous integration and delivery service built into Xcode and designed exclusively for Apple developers. In other sessions, we've shown how you can set up end-to-end workflows to continuously build, test, and distribute your apps. In this session, we're going to talk about some more advanced features that you can use to customize Xcode Cloud to better fit your team's needs. Xcode Cloud is designed to integrate with Apple developer tools and services -- like the developer website, TestFlight, and App Store Connect -- right out of the box. It also integrates with your essential, day-to-day development tools, like all major Git-based source control providers, and even Slack for messaging. However, you may have in-house or proprietary tools and other external services that are a key part of your pipeline. In this session, we'll demonstrate how you can customize Xcode Cloud to integrate well with these tools and services. We're going to cover four customization topics. First, we'll discuss using environment variables to pass extra bits of information into your builds. We'll learn how to use scripts to run custom commands in the actions you run in your build. And also how to add other source repositories that you need during a build. And finally, how you can use webhooks to integrate Xcode Cloud with other systems your team uses. There's a lot to cover, so let's get straight into it with environment variables. As you plan and configure workflows for your project, there may be times when you want the behavior of your build to be slightly different depending on which workflow is running. For example, if your app depends on an API service, you may want your tests to use a staging environment rather than production. In this case, you'd want to pass a different URL for the API service into your tests. Environment variables allow you to do just that. They're simple key-value pairs that allow you to define some information that you can use to further control the behavior of your build. You can configure any environment variables you need right in the Environment section of your workflow. Since they're part of your workflow configuration, you don't have to commit any additional information to your source repository. Every time your workflow runs, the variables you've defined will be set in the environments that are running the actions. For sensitive information, like API keys or access tokens, you can configure a secret environment variable. Secret environment variables are handled securely. They're encrypted and stored securely at all times, and their decrypted values are only available in the temporary environments that are used to run your actions. The values are also redacted from logs, and you can't view them in the workflow editor like you can for a nonsecret variable. Making an environment variable secret is easy. Just check the \"Secret\" checkbox in the environment variables table. The value of your environment variable will then be hidden from view and once you save your change, will be stored securely and can no longer be viewed in the workflow editor. Environment variables provide a handy mechanism to customize behavior and pass additional information into your workflows. They're even more powerful in conjunction with our next advanced feature: custom scripts. Between Xcode Cloud's workflows and Xcode's schemes, you have a lot of flexibility in how you can set up the actions that you want to run in your workflows. But sometimes you'll need to run custom logic or additional commands during an action, and custom scripts provide a powerful and flexible way to achieve this. A custom script is a shell script that you write and include in your source repository. Your custom scripts are run in each of the actions in your workflow. There are three types of scripts available: the post-clone script, the pre-Xcodebuild script, and the post-Xcodebuild script. Each time Xcode Cloud runs an action it performs a series of steps and each of the custom scripts, as hinted at by its name, is run as a step at a particular point in an action. First, Xcode Cloud sets up a temporary environment and clones source code from your primary repository. Afterwards, Xcode Cloud runs the post-clone script. After resolving all other source dependencies, Xcode cloud runs the pre-Xcodebuild script. Next, Xcode Cloud runs the action's corresponding Xcodebuild command. When the Xcodebuild step finishes, Xcode Cloud runs the post-Xcodebuild script and saves any artifacts it generated earlier. If your workflow includes several actions -- for example, multiple build actions -- or build, test, analyze, and archive actions -- Xcode Cloud runs your custom scripts at the appropriate times for each action. Adding a custom script to Xcode Cloud is easy. You simply add a shell script with the appropriate name into a folder called \"ci_scripts\", and place this folder at the same level as the project file or workspace you're using in your workflow. Since custom scripts are part of your source code, you can test out script changes in pull requests or even customize their behavior on different branches. When Xcode Cloud runs your actions, it looks for the existence of each of the scripts at the appropriate time and runs them if they're present. You don't need to configure your workflow to run your custom scripts. If the scripts are there, they'll be run. Do note that the name of the ci_scripts folder and the scripts inside must exactly match this naming convention in order for Xcode Cloud to find and run your scripts. Environment variables that you've configured in your workflow are available to use in your custom scripts, including secret environment variables. In addition, Xcode Cloud also provides a variety of other useful environment variables. You can use these variables to add flow control to your scripts, so that you can ensure the commands you want to run are run at the correct points during your workflow. For example, if you want to check if your action is running for iOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS, you can use the value of the CI_PRODUCT_PLATFORM variable. In a more targeted scenario -- perhaps there's a command you only want to run during the archive action of a specific workflow -- you can check that the CI_XCODEBUILD_ACTION and CI_WORKFLOW variables match the archive action and the specific workflow before running the command. Let's see custom scripts in action. My team works on a smoothie ordering app called Fruta. In the \"Explore Xcode Cloud workflows\" session, you learned how to set up workflows to build, test, and distribute apps, like Fruta. We use Xcode Cloud to build and test every time we create a pull request. We also distribute builds from our pull requests to members of our team via TestFlight, allowing them to verify and sign off on changes before the code is merged. Today, I'd like to make it easier for team members to tell if the build installed on their device is from a pull request. We can do that by using a different app icon when we're building from a pull request. As you might've guessed, using a custom script makes setting this up a breeze. Let's see how.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Patrick Angle: Hi! I’m Patrick, an engineer on the WebKit Developer Experience team, and it is my pleasure to show you some of the many exciting features and improvements that are new in Web Inspector this year. Web Inspector is part of Safari on macOS and gives web developers and designers access to a rich set of tools to inspect their web pages and web applications. It allows you to inspect all the resources and activity on a web page, and works seamlessly across macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS. This year, I am thrilled to show you new features in Web Inspector starting with a new overlay for visualizing your CSS Grids, enhancements to breakpoints, and the ability to author and edit audits right in Web Inspector. Before I talk about these new features, if you haven’t used Web Inspector before, you’ll have to enable it. In the Advanced tab of Safari’s Preferences, enable “Show Develop menu in menu bar”. Web Inspector can then be opened using the Show Web Inspector item in the Develop menu. Now that Web Inspector is enabled, let’s look at our first new tool this year: grid overlays. Web page layout these days can be quite complicated. CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that makes it easy for designers to lay out content in a way that is both incredibly powerful as well as instantly familiar to anyone who has ever worked in printed design. A structure of rows and columns is defined where elements are then placed or distributed in the grid to achieve a flexible yet predictable layout. Grid is a highly capable way to lay out your web page, but it can bring a host of new questions and confusion as your layouts become more complex. Like, Why is my column this size? Or, Why is this blue box down here? Previously in Web Inspector, the primary source of answers to these pressing questions was the Style sidebar in the Elements tab, which this year has moved to its own independent sidebar, allowing you to view matching CSS rules alongside other panels like Computed styles. If you look at a grid’s authored style, you can glean some information about its layout. But the grid’s authored style only gets you part of the way there. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a more visual way to digest this information with Web Inspector? Well, now there is! If you look at the elements in the DOM tree, you’ll see a new clickable grid badge next to each of the elements that are a CSS Grid. Here, we see the badge for one of the two CSS Grids on our page. If we click this new badge and return to our web page, you can see the new grid overlay on top of your existing content, allowing you to visualize the layout of the grid inline without the mental gymnastics of reading your authored CSS and hoping it does what you think it will. But what if this isn’t the exact information you want to see about your grid? What about grid areas, line names, and other options? To answer that, let’s return to Web Inspector. Here, you can find another new feature, the Layout panel, which shows all the options and controls related to grid overlays. First, let's take a look at the list of grids on the page. Here you have the option to toggle all of the grid overlays on or off all at once. Or you can toggle a single grid’s overlay off or on. Each grid is listed with its corresponding CSS selector to help identify it in the list. Next to each listed grid is a color swatch that allows you to interactively change the color of the grid overlay, and the badges on each element will use this color when that grid overlay is enabled. Web Inspector will remember your color for each element the next time the same page is loaded. Now let’s take a look at the options we have to control how these overlays are displayed, starting with track sizes, which show the authored sizes of each track -- which is a row or column -- of your grid. Like here, where a mix of fractional units and min-content are used. Next, line numbers show you the values that can be used to place child elements at specific rows or columns in your grid. We’ve placed negative line numbers -- which represent line numbers counting from the last explicit grid line -- inside the label, alongside the positive line numbers to allow you to choose how you want to place your item. Line names provide another way to refer to your lines in your grid based on area names as well as lines that have been explicitly named. Area names allow you to see each of the named areas in your grid, which is helpful if you want to place children in your grid without addressing the lines on each side of your desired placement. We’ve placed area names in the center of each area and outlined each area in a thick stroke. Lastly, turning on extended gridlines on this second grid container allows you to see the track lines extended to the edge of the page, allowing you to visually compare the grid’s alignment to other elements on your page. We’ve built our overlays with performance in mind, and you can enable as many as you need, all while smoothly scrolling through your page. Dozens of grids can be shown simultaneously, all while providing you buttery-smooth scrolling. They work for all writing modes like this vertically set text originally from Wikipedia, right-to-left text direction, and combinations thereof. And these overlays are also available on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 when inspecting remotely from a Mac with Safari 15 or the latest Safari Technology Preview. We believe that grid is an incredibly important layout tool on the web, and that is why we have brought these tools to Web Inspector, enabling you to visualize and debug grid across all of our platforms to continue to create incredible layouts. Now let’s take a look at how grid overlays can help us to better understand and solve problems on our web pages. Let’s take a look at a web page I’ve been working on that gives me a quick overview of information I want to see each morning. I can see my commute, the weather forecast for the day -- looks like I’ll want a jacket tonight! -- and a list of things to pick up at the store after work today. This page is laid out with CSS Grid, which made it easy to create these varying sized tiles and place them on my page. But wait, it looks like I forgot to place one of these fun emojis I used to decorate my dashboard. It belongs down here with the rest of my emojis! No problem. I can use our new grid overlay to help me place it exactly where I’d like. To begin inspecting my page, I’ll right-click on my problematic element and select Inspect Element. If you don’t see Inspect Element, make sure to enable Web Inspector like we discussed earlier. I’ll then select the Layout panel in the Details sidebar, where I can see all the grid contexts on my page. I can’t quite remember which of these grids I want to work with, but I can enable all of the overlays at once by checking the top checkbox for all grid overlays. I now see the grid context I want to work with is the pink one, which holds all of my tiles. I’ll just turn off the other two overlays by unchecking them in this list of grid contexts. And now I’m left with only the grid overlay I’m interested in. If you're like me, you may only want to see exactly the information you need to perform the task at hand, so I’m going to disable Track Sizes labels so I can focus just on the line numbers for placing my stray emoji. And now the remaining line number labels let me see exactly where I want to place my emoji: at column track line 6 and row track line 4. Because I explicitly right-clicked and inspected the tile for my problematic emoji, it's already selected for me, and I can jump right to editing its style to test my fix. And with our new three-panel layout, I can keep the Layout panel visible at the same time, which is great for when I want to switch which labels or grid overlays I’m showing while testing different styles on my page without constantly switching between panels. In the Styles panel, I'm going to click in the Style Attribute section and add a new property, grid-area. I can then type a colon to jump to editing my new property's value where I will enter \"4 / 6\" for row track line 4 and column track line 6. Perfect, my emoji is right where I want it now. But now that I think about it some more, I really want to make sure this emoji is always in this corner, even if I add or remove rows or columns from my grid later. In the same labels that gave me values of row track line 4 and column track line 6, I see a second line number, -3, for each. This negative line number will actually keep my emoji three track lines from the end of the grid I’ve explicitly defined, and will be perfect for my situation. I’ll update my grid-area property’s value to these new values, \"-3 / -3\", and see that my emoji is still in the correct place, and will continue to be if I add another row or remove another column from my grid. This new overlay coming to Web Inspector helped me quickly adjust the layout of my page, and is great for understanding existing layouts as well as designing new layouts. Now let’s talk about improvements in JavaScript debugging with breakpoints. For scripts, we often start with console.log as we try to figure out why our script isn’t working the way we think it should. Alternatively, if you’ve never tried breakpoints, I highly recommend checking them out. They are powerful and, as we’ll see in just a moment, even more configurable than before. If you're new to breakpoints, the easiest way to get started is in the Sources tab by clicking in the line gutter of your JavaScript on a line at which you’d like to pause. This creates a breakpoint which, when reached, will pause your script at the beginning of that line, waiting to execute the line; allow you to step through your code one statement at a time; or dive deeper into a specific statement; and view the state of your variables every step of the way. But there's so much more to breakpoints! In fact, there are five different types of breakpoints, one for every occasion. There are breakpoints for debugger statements, exceptions, and assertions; JavaScript breakpoints, which you can set on lines of JavaScript; event breakpoints, which pause when an event like click, timeouts, intervals, or animation frames are handled; DOM breakpoints, which pause when actions related to a DOM node occur. These can be added in the Elements tab, or from the context menu for any node preview in Web Inspector. And URL breakpoints, which pause when a network request is about to be made for a URL via APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch. You can configure your JavaScript breakpoints by right-clicking on a breakpoint and selecting Edit Breakpoint. Here, you can control numerous aspects of the breakpoint. Let’s take a look at each of these options. We can set a condition, which must be true for the breakpoint to be hit. New this year, we now support using Web Inspector’s Console tab API inside expressions in breakpoint conditions and actions, like this one that refers to the currently selected DOM node in the Elements tab. In some cases, a breakpoint condition may be better expressed as a number of times to ignore the breakpoint before it is hit, like while inside a loop where we don’t want to stop until some number of iterations have been completed. This can be used in addition to or instead of a condition to control when the breakpoint will fire. When used in addition to a condition, the count of ignored invocations is incremented only if the condition was satisfied. Next, you can define actions that are taken when your breakpoint is hit, like evaluating JavaScript in context with access to variables, as if the code was inline in your JavaScript source; log messages to the console easily with a template string literal; play a system beep so you audibly know the breakpoint was hit; and define a probe expression, which is evaluated with its result saved in the Probe panel of the Details sidebar of the Sources tab, allowing you to see the results of the expression as it changes over the lifetime of your web page. New this year, the action types that support JavaScript expressions can be set to emulate a user gesture, which can be helpful when interacting with JavaScript APIs that normally require a user to have initiated them, like playing a video, enabling you to quickly test new behavior before implementing the change in the web page’s source. You can mix and match any number of these actions to customize your breakpoints, including multiple of any action type. Lastly, you can have your breakpoint automatically continue after evaluating and performing your actions for situations where you just wanted to add some logging or a quick patch to test without modifying the underlying web page. These options for configuring breakpoints are incredibly versatile, and this year I’m pleased to tell you that they are now available for all breakpoint types, not just JavaScript breakpoints. This enables you to set powerful breakpoint conditions, like only pausing on click events for a specific type of element, like button; or playing a system beep when a network request is made for a specific URL. These configuration options being available for all breakpoint types make already great debugging tools even better by helping you cut through the noise -- or even make a little noise -- at just the right time. Now, let’s return to my dashboard web page and take a look at an issue that these new tools will make a breeze to debug and test a patch for. I recently added a button to my commute tile that I want to use to share my estimated commute time with someone else. You never know when you might end up running late. Unfortunately, when I click my Share button, nothing happens. Even worse, it’s been a few days since I’ve worked on this tile and I don’t remember where I handle click events for this button. Fortunately, I can use an event breakpoint to pause in my click event handler to find my code. I can create event breakpoints here in the Sources tab. Clicking the plus in the top right of the breakpoint section of the Navigation Sidebar, and selecting Event Breakpoint, allows me to define a new event breakpoint. I’ll set the event to click, and then press the Return key to create my new breakpoint. I now see my click breakpoint listed in the Navigation Sidebar. This event breakpoint should pause when I click my button. But first, I want to make sure I’m sharing the most up-to-date time estimate for my commute, so I’ll click my Refresh button and -- Oops! My event breakpoint will actually pause for all click events, including my Refresh button, even though I really only want to pause when I click on my Share button. Let’s modify my breakpoint using the new configuration options that are available this year. I can edit my breakpoint by right-clicking on it and choosing Edit Breakpoint. Here, I get a popover with the configuration options for the event breakpoint. I need to add a condition to make sure I only pause when I need to. In this case, I can use some Web Inspector console API to get the current event with \"$event\", and check if the event’s target is equal to my Share button. Instead of hard-coding my breakpoint for this specific button, I’ll use another piece of console API to check if the event’s target is the currently selected DOM node in the Elements tab with \"$0\". I can click out of the configuration popover and all my changes are automatically applied. I’m still paused on my breakpoint from clicking on the Refresh button, so I’ll click the Continue button to resume script execution on my page. Now, when I click on my Refresh button, my commute time updates and my breakpoint isn’t hit. But if I right-click on my Share button, and select Inspect Element to make it the selected element, I can now click on my Share button and bingo! The breakpoint paused exactly where I wanted it to, and now I see why my Share button doesn’t work: I forgot to write this function. Breakpoints can save the day -- or at least this demo -- again, and help me patch sharing in right now to test my changes before I go back to the source to implement them. I’ll add a breakpoint in my share function by clicking in the line gutter, right-clicking on the breakpoint indicator, and choosing Edit Breakpoint. I don’t need a condition on this breakpoint, but I want to add an action. The default action type, Evaluate JavaScript, is exactly what I want here. I’ll add my JavaScript to the action, which will call \"navigator.share\" with an object I’ve already prepared with my data, \"this.shareData\". I don’t actually need to pause my script as part of testing this fix, so I’ll also enable Automatically continue after evaluating. Like before, clicking outside the popover saves my changes. I'm done with my click event breakpoint for now, so let's click on its indicator to disable it. I'll also click the Continue button to resume script execution on my page. I can now click on my Share button, and am presented with the Share menu. I'll select Notes to confirm my share data is correct. This looks correct, so now I can go back to my source code and make this change. Awesome! These enhancements to breakpoints made it possible to identify and test a solution without having to pepper my source with console.log statements. And now that I have a working solution, I can go add my fix to my source. Now let’s take a look at an exciting new feature for audits: the ability to create and edit your tests right in Web Inspector. Each test in the Audit tab is written in JavaScript and is run against the inspected web page. These tests can check for incorrect DOM structure, help enforce design system rules, or help make sure you haven’t missed accessibility attributes. In addition to individual tests, you can share and run groups of tests. By default, Web Inspector has two test groups: the Demo Audit, which provides a tour of the way audits work and the functionality they support, and a suite of accessibility tests that check for a subset of the DOM accessibility best practices in accordance with the ARIA specification, such as ensuring that a title or alternate text is set on all image elements. You can run a test by selecting it and using the Start button next to the audit name, or run all of your tests with the Start button at the top of the Navigation Sidebar. After your tests have run, you can see the results of each test as well as an overall summary of passes and failures. If there are any failures, you can see information about those failures so you can get them patched up. To share your tests, or to edit them in an external text editor, you can export the test, make your changes to the resulting JSON file, and then import the modified test back into Web Inspector. This process of exporting and importing is great for sharing your tests across your team or with the community. And this year, we are making creating and editing tests even easier with a new Edit mode. When you click on the Edit button in the bottom of the Navigation Sidebar, the Audit tab transforms into Editing mode, where you now have the ability to create new tests as well as edit your existing tests. Note that the default Demo Audit and Accessibility test groups cannot be deleted or edited, but can be duplicated and then the duplicate can be edited. For now, let’s look at creating a new test by using the Create item in the Navigation Sidebar. You can create a new test case, or a group of test cases. For now, let’s look at creating a new test case. When we create a new test case, you see that it is added to the Navigation Sidebar, and the default contents of the test appear for you to edit. Here you have several different things available to configure. The name, as well as the description of the test, and the minimum audit version the test supports, which makes sure the audit is not run in an older version of Web Inspector where some features may not be supported. The setup script is JavaScript that will be executed before every top-level test or test group. This allows you to perform common setup functions that all tests under this top-level test rely on. And last, but certainly not least, there is the test itself, which is a JavaScript function that can return true or false or a result object with more information about the test’s run. A special WebInspectorAudit object is also available, which exposes additional API specifically for tests to use in both the test itself as well as the setup for the test. You can learn more about this API in the Web Inspector Reference. Your changes are automatically saved, and all of this can now be done in Web Inspector without exporting. But to really get a feel for the flexibility of these tests, I’d like to show you them in action. Let’s return to my dashboard one last time and see how audits can help me catch some types of accessibility problems as well as design issues in my web page. The first thing I like to do when I open the Audit tab is to run the default Accessibility test cases. These will help me get a good baseline reading for how I’m doing on common accessibility best practices. I can quickly run these tests by clicking on the Run button next to the test group. And not bad, but I can do better. I can look at the test failures by clicking the Passed filter button to hide those results, leaving only my test failure to view. Let’s get this fixed. This test provides a list of DOM nodes that failed, making it easy to jump to that node using the Reveal in Elements Tab button that appears on hover. In the Elements tab, I’ll test adding a title to my image by right-clicking on the DOM node choosing Add > Attribute, and typing my new title.",

    "video_transcript": "Welcome to WWDC. Hi, I'm Jonathan Metzgar. I'm a member of the Metal Ecosystem team at Apple. We get to work with game developers to help them get the best graphics performance on our Apple GPUs. Dustin and I are going to show you how we optimize high-end games for Apple GPUs. In this video, I'm going to cover the process that we use to optimize games. Then, I'm going to show you the kinds of optimizations that are used in the games Baldur's Gate 3 and Metro Exodus. And lastly, Dustin is going to do a tools demonstration featuring the game Divinity: Original Sin 2, while he introduces the new GPU Timeline in Xcode 13. Let's dive in and talk about optimization. So, over the past year, we collaborated with Larian Studios and 4A Games to find ways to tune the graphics performance in their games for Apple GPUs. I am sure you'll be excited to see the details, and I want to take a moment and thank both Larian Studios and 4A Games for giving us permission to show development materials in this presentation. Looking back over the course of the year, we have analyzed many games and identified some common scenarios that affect graphics performance. You're probably interested in finding opportunities to optimize your own game, so we have geared this session to emphasize how our GPU tools are especially helpful in pinpointing these problem areas and to suggest ways to solve them. And, in particular, I'd like to share some of the principles our team uses to help developers optimize their games. When we optimize a graphics application, it's important to have a methodology, a set of principles that define how we solve a particular problem. So, let me show you a four-step process. First, you need to choose what data to collect, or measure, so it will help you understand what's happening with your game. Soon after you begin measuring data, you will want to choose some performance targets, or where you want to be when you finish. You may decide the in-game location to take your GPU frame captures and Metal system traces, the scene complexity, graphics settings, and other metrics important to you, like frame time. Then, you analyze the data to learn about the behavior of your engine. In-depth analysis helps you find where and why the bottlenecks are occurring. Once you know what is causing a bottleneck, then you can make improvements to the game, but normally you pick one or two at a time, so you can understand the impact of each change. Lastly, you verify your improvements by comparing some new measurements with your original ones. Since optimization is a process, you will go back and repeat until your performance targets have been met. For these games, we use Xcode's Metal Debugger to give us insights about their performance and how their frame graphs are structured, and we use Metal System Trace in Instruments to learn about a game's performance over time. It's a great idea to save a GPU trace file and an Instruments trace file so you can have your before and after data, both before and after optimization. So, I have a little list of things you could consider, or look for, in your game. As I mentioned, Xcode and Instruments are great tools to help you understand your Metal application. Optimization is about getting the best out of several areas, ranging from shader performance to memory bandwidth. Another area is getting good overlap across your vertex, fragment, and compute workloads. And while rendering several frames in flight, some Apple GPUs can overlap workloads between them. I'll show you some pointers to help you with resource dependencies, which might prevent that overlap. And since some developers use a custom workflow for their shaders, I'll show you how compiler settings can affect performance. Lastly, I'll talk about how to reduce the impact of redundant bindings. Let's start with Baldur's Gate 3 from Larian Studios. Baldur's Gate 3 is an RPG building on a 20-year gaming legacy and stands out with its cinematic visual effects. Our engagement with Larian Studios helped us identify how they could optimize their amazing rendering engine for Apple GPUs. First, we started with a GPU frame capture, like the Ravaged Beach scene we see here. Then, we break down the scene into a frame graph. The frame graph is a breakdown of the order and purpose of each rendering pass. High-end games have many render passes specializing in achieving a certain visual effect, such as ambient occlusion, shadow mapping, post processing, and so on. Baldur's Gate 3 has a complex frame graph, so this is a simplified version. By using Xcode's Metal Debugger, we capture a GPU trace and use it to see all the render passes in the game. Clicking on Show Dependencies brings up a visualization that you can pan and zoom. It shows how your render passes depend on the results of previous ones to help you understand what's going on. For example, I am zooming into this deferred decal render stage to get more details. Next, I will show you the Instruments tools. We spend time analyzing games using the Instruments trace, using the Metal System Trace, or Game performance templates. Metal System Trace is ideal if you wanna focus on GPU execution and scheduling analysis, and Game Performance expands on that to help you with other issues, like thread stalls or thermal notifications. Let's choose Metal System Trace to see the behavior of our engine from frame to frame. Instruments allows you to view several channels of data along a timeline. Here, we find our first problem: An expensive workload in our render passes. An expensive workload might mean that we need to optimize a shader. For instance, we see a long compute shader holding up the rest of our frame. We call these gaps \"bubbles.\" Let's switch back over to the GPU trace and investigate this further. This is the \"before\" GPU trace. Let's change the grouping from API CALL to PIPELINE STATE. You may notice the pipeline states are sorted by execution time. Let's check the first compute pipeline. We can expand the compute function details to take a closer look at its statistics. Notice here that there are over four-and-a-half-thousand instructions. That's quite a lot. So, what else? Let's see what resources are being used by this compute function. Depending on the input data, this function uses up to 120 textures to produce the output. However, we discovered that only six to 12 are actually used 90% of the time. So, let's talk about how this shader could be improved. Shaders that need to handle many different conditions can reserve more registers than necessary, and this can reduce the number of threads that run in parallel. Splitting your workload into smaller, more focused shaders, which need fewer registers, can improve the utilization of the shader cores. So, instead of selecting the appropriate algorithm in the shader, you would choose the appropriate shader permutation when you issue your GPU workload. Additionally, a shader function which uses too many registers can result in register pressure, when an execution unit runs out of fast register memory and has to use device memory instead. That's one reason to use 16-bit types, like half, when appropriate, since they use half the register space than 32-bit types, like floats. In this case, Larian Studios already optimized their shader to use half-precision floating point and decided to create dedicated shader variants, instead. So, let's see what happened. When comparing the numbers before, in the box on the left, with the numbers in the box on the right, the number of instructions reduced by 84%, branches reduced 90%, registers reduced 25%, and texture reads reduced 92%. This shader variant is used 90% of the time. We can also see this in the Metal System Trace. Notice here, in the before trace, the bubbles we saw earlier. And here, in the after trace, they have been minimized. Larian Studios was able to reduce this shader by eight milliseconds, on average. That is a huge win! If you look at your most expensive pipeline state objects and shaders, you may find a complicated shader that could be simplified. This is especially true if the results of that shader are used by a later pass. This was a huge improvement for the game, but short of the developer's performance target. We just mentioned memory as an issue, and one of the features of our GPUs is lossless compression, which is enabled in certain conditions. So, maybe there was a flag we either accidentally set or forgot to set. Lossless compression helps reduce bandwidth by compressing textures when they are stored from tile to device memory. If you look at the Bandwidth Insights on the Summary page, you may notice Lossless Compression warnings for some textures. They tell you that these textures can't be lossless compressed, and you may pay a bandwidth penalty. Metal Debugger will also let you know why these textures can't be lossless compressed. Here we see it's because of the ShaderWrite usage flag. We can see all the usage flags by going to the memory section. Once in the memory section, we can filter by render targets. Then, right click on the table header, choose texture, and then usage. Now, we can sort by usage and find the textures using ShaderWrite. If you set the ShaderWrite or PixelFormatView flag when you create your textures, you will disable lossless compression. Let's take a look at these flags in more detail. The Unknown, ShaderWrite, and PixelFormatView flags prevent your textures from being lossless compressed. The general rule of thumb is to use these flags only when required. For example, you would use the ShaderWrite flag if you use the write() method to store values in a texture from a fragment or compute function. Rendering to a texture bound as a color attachment doesn't require the ShaderWrite flag. And don't set the PixelFormatView option if you only need to read the component values in a different order. Instead, create a texture view using a swizzle pattern to specify the new order. Similarly, don't set the PixelFormatView option if your texture view only converts between linear space and sRGB. Check the documentation for more information. Shader optimization and lossless compression are two techniques that have helped us out, but another problem area is getting good overlap across the vertex, fragment, and compute channels. Let's take a look at two ways to optimize workloads across channels. First, we'll start by looking at our Metal System Trace again. Here, we can see that we have low overlap on our vertex, fragment, and compute channels. It would be nice to improve this to keep the GPU busy. One way to solve this problem is to see if we can restructure the encoding order in our frame graph. In other words, we want to move this work over to where the vertex stage has very low occupancy. We would like to process those vertices earlier, along with the fragment stage of an earlier render pass. We can think of our frame graph as a list of rendering tasks, like this pseudocode example. Getting good overlap can be as simple as changing the order of your render tasks in your frame graph. Some tasks may rely on results from earlier ones, but not always. It turns out that the CascadedShadowBuffer stage, which is vertex-shader heavy, could be moved a few tasks earlier, since it has few dependencies. And now, we see that our region with low overlap has better utilization of the vertex and fragment channels, giving us another 1 ms win. But there is another optimization that we can try out. Games often have two to three frames in flight. So, a cool feature in our tile-based deferred rendering, or TBDR architecture GPUs, is to overlap workloads from two frames when there are no resource dependencies between them. So, I'm going to show you how to optimize for this possibility. Let's have a look at the GPU track in Instruments once again. Here, you can see that these frames are processed, almost serially. This is caused by using a blit encoder to update constant buffers, like per-frame animation data, and so on. To efficiently update constant buffer data with a discrete GPU, we blit from shared buffers on the CPU to a private buffer on the GPU, which will be used for rendering the frame. This strategy is efficient for GPUs with discrete memory, so you want to keep this behavior for that purpose. If your device has a unified memory architecture, then there is no need to use a blit encoder to copy your data to a private buffer. However, when you use a shared buffer in a ring-buffer pattern, you need to watch out for synchronization issues because visual corruption can happen if your CPU writes to data currently being read by the GPU. Let's see this in action. Here, you can see in this diagram the encoding and rendering of our frames. We are using colors to represent the shared buffers, which are updated at the beginning of the frame: blue for buffer one, green for buffer two, and yellow for buffer three. Ring buffers are typically used to implement queues, which need to use a compact amount of memory. Here, there is no concern of a data race condition with this arrangement, as our writing and reading of our shared buffers is mutually exclusive. It's very common to have latency between encoding the frame and the rendering of a frame. This causes a shift of when the rendering actually begins. As long as the latency isn't too long, you will not have a data race condition. However, what happens if latency continues to increase? Well, this introduces a data race condition, where the main thread is updating its shared buffers during the time the GPU is rendering the frame. And if that happens, you could get visual corruption if elements of your frame are dependent on this data. In the case of Baldur's Gate 3, removing the private buffer and blit encoder eliminated the synchronization point, but introduced a race condition, which affected their temporal anti-aliasing render pass. So, let's see how to avoid this situation. To avoid this race condition, you need to make sure you are not writing into the same resource the GPU is reading from. For example, you could utilize a completion handler, and then wait until it is safe to update the shared buffer in your encoding thread. But let me show you how we avoided a wait time. We maintained our completion handler, but added an extra buffer to our ring buffer to avoid the wait. The extra buffer is colored purple on the bottom diagram. The memory consumption remains the same as with a discrete GPU. But if you need to save on memory, and the CPU wait time doesn't affect frame rate of your game, then you can just use three buffers. So, let's look at an easy way to decide how many shared and private buffers to create with a pseudocode example. In this code snippet, you can see how to choose the number of shared and private buffers at initialization time. Once we have created our device, we can check to see if the device has unified memory or not, and then ensure that we create an extra shared buffer, or to use a private buffer. This extra buffer will help reduce the impact of waiting for a completion handler, which we are using to avoid a data race condition. And now, we can see how Fragment workloads from the previous frame overlaps with Vertex workloads from the next frame. Overall, this can give us one to two milliseconds, depending on the scene. And, of course, this approach can be applied not only for the constant buffer data we've shown in this example, but for all of the buffer data you transfer from the CPU to the GPU. So, let's review. Larian Studios was able to achieve their performance targets by applying the following optimizations: Optimizing their most expensive shaders to reduce bubbles, opting in to lossless compression to improve bandwidth, overlapping vertex and fragment workloads to get better GPU utilization, and checking for resource dependencies that prevent frame overlap. When they were finished, Larian Studios not only met their performance targets, but got a 33% improvement in frame time for their game. And now, we will look at a different set of optimizations with the game Metro Exodus. Metro Exodus is known for its epic storyline and demanding visual effects, as you can see in this series of game-play clips. After the integration of our suggested optimizations, 4A Games was able to meet their performance targets. So now, let's have a look at an in-game scene from Metro Exodus. Metro Exodus uses a custom workflow to translate render commands into Metal API commands, which is quite common for cross-platform games. The translation layer they are using is optimized for Metal, but some issues can arise when two complex systems come together in practice. So, additional performance tuning was required to meet their project goals. As in the previous game, we start by investigating how a frame is being rendered. Modern renderers have a lot of different techniques involved so first we try to understand the high-level frame graph. Again, we start analysis by looking at the GPU trace. It always gives us useful insights about game performance. So first, let's start with the GPU time, which doesn't meet the developer performance targets. So, let's find the shader or pipeline which is the most time-consuming. To do this, we are going to group by pipeline state once again and look at the most expensive one. Let's quickly look at its statistics. You can see that there is a high number of ALU instructions compared to the total, meaning this is a math-heavy shader. We also see that the number of registers being used by the shader is quite high. The number of registers used by a particular shader directly affects how its workload will scale during execution. The higher this number is, the less work can be done in parallel by the GPU. Sometimes it's just a complex shader, such as SSAO in this example, that requires lots of computations and registers, but sometimes the compiler settings can affect the generated instructions and register allocation, as well. Let's also take a look at the shader compiler options. And it turns out, this shader was compiled with the fast math flag disabled. Fast math allows the shader compiler to optimize various instructions, and it is enabled for the Metal shader compiler, by default. However, there might be some cases, for example, using custom shader workflows, that can disable this compilation flag. In this case, we discovered that the translation layer, which 4A Games was using to invoke the compiler, had its default behavior set to not use fast math. So, what is fast math? Fast math is a set of optimizations for floating-point arithmetic, that trades between speed and correctness. For example, assumptions can be made that there will be no NANs, infinity, or signed zeros as either a result or argument. Fast math optimizations can also apply algebraically-equivalent transformations, which may affect the precision in floating-point results. However in most scenarios, fast math is a great choice for games. This can significantly improve performance, especially in ALU-bound cases. Our recommendation to you is to check your compiler options to verify that you have enabled fast math, if your shaders do not depend on the things that we just mentioned.",

    "video_transcript": "My name is Lucy Zhang, and I'm a software engineer on the Installation and Software Update team. I'll be talking about managed software updates for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS today. Software updates are critical to everyone using Apple products. Updates bring new security enhancements, like notarization and the sealed system volume in macOS Big Sur. They enable all the latest features, and maybe most importantly, that's how you get all the new emojis. Our platform makes it easy to update your device. In fact, 86% of all iPhones introduced in the last four years use iOS 14. However, in managed environments, you need more control over this process. When managing a fleet of devices, you want to keep them up to date, but you need time to test updates before releasing them, to ensure that the OS is compatible with your software. After your testing is complete, you want to ensure that updates are installed as soon as possible, while minimizing disruption to the user. In this session, we will first explore the programs and restrictions that allow you to test beta and newly released software updates. Next, the MDM commands for deploying updates. And finally, I can't wait to tell you about a new way you can ensure users get updated to the latest version you're ready to support. Let's get started with testing updates. When Apple releases a beta OS, you have time and tools to test the OS in your environment before it's released. AppleSeed for IT help you access and test new Apple software while it's in beta. Any non-student Managed Apple ID from Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager can participate in the program, which gives you access to pre-release Apple software for testing in your environment, and includes detailed test plans and a way to provide feedback. Once the update is publicly released, you may still need time to test, and you don't want the update to be available to all your users yet. For that, you have deferral. Deferral prevents supervised devices from offering software updates to users, until a specified period of time has expired since those updates were published by Apple. When you apply a deferral restriction, the default delay is 30 days since update publication. You can also specify a custom value between 1 and 90 days. When an update has been available long enough for the specified delay to expire, that update is offered to users as part of the standard software update notifications and update process. These restrictions give you more granular control over the Software Update interface in System Preferences. The deferred updates restriction only affects the Software Update interface. It does not change the behavior of MDM commands. Even with a restriction set, MDM has the ability to send specific updates to devices. For iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, deferring software updates is available in iOS 11.3 or later, iPadOS 13.1 or later, and tvOS 12.2 or later. When you defer updates, you set the same deferral window for major and minor updates. For Mac computers, deferring software updates is available in macOS 10.13 or later. In macOS 11.3 or later, an admin may now choose to delay major releases for longer than minor releases. That way, users can still benefit from important security updates, while the admin works to approve the latest major release for production in their environment. These are the keys that you can set in a profile to install on the Mac computer. Use the forceDelayedMajorSoftwareUpdates key to defer a major release. With this key, you can still receive minor OS and security updates, while deferring a major OS update. There may be times where you want to separately defer a minor release, and you'll use the forceDelayedSoftwareUpdates key to do that. And for separately deferring supplemental updates, you'll use the forceDelayedAppSoftwareUpdates key. If a deferral type is enabled, but there is no corresponding deferral period set, we will fallback to using the old key, ManagedDeferredInstallDelay. When there are deferral restrictions in place, this is how the software update preference pane appears on macOS. Let's explore how deferral might work. Back to the timeline, you've now deferred an update and continued testing the new OS for compatibility in your environment. Once you've confirmed the OS and completed testing, you're ready to push it to users. You want devices to update when users are ready, and it's not intrusive to their workflow. So let's explore deploying updates. There are a few steps to install the right update on the right device, and with macOS Monterey, there's more parity than ever before between macOS and iOS. The first step in deploying updates for all platforms is to check for updates and confirm device eligibility. Here's how that was done for Mac prior to macOS Monterey. Available OS updates were only able to be evaluated on the user's device. You used the command ScheduleOSUpdateScan, which tells the Mac to query the server for available OS updates, and then evaluates the updates to determine eligibility. Once the scan finished and was sent back to the MDM server, the MDM could then choose an update to deploy. However, Apple provides the Apple Software Lookup service, which provides a list of available OS versions across platforms. Here, we are presented with the iOS devices. You may already be using the feed for iPhone and iPad to reduce the back-and-forth that comes with the ScheduleOSUpdateScan for Mac. For iOS, MDM solutions use the Apple Software Lookup Service to be aware of available updates to push the command directly to the device. Here's how: First, the MDM Server can get a list of available updates, such as 12.1 or 12.2, from the Apple Software Lookup Service. When you're ready to deploy an update, the MDM server will send the update version to the device. Then, the device will reach the software update server to verify that the update is eligible and begin to download and install it. New with macOS Monterey, we are unifying this process for macOS and iOS. We now support a new DeviceInformation query key called SoftwareUpdateModelID, which returns the hardware model string for iOS and macOS to MDM. The Apple Software Lookup Service will include the appropriate hardware identifier for macOS, allowing MDM servers to determine the applicability of an update without the AvailableOSUpdates command. Just like on iOS, the MDM will be able to determine update applicability by comparing the result from DeviceInformation query to the device IDs listed in the JSON feed. Also, until now, macOS has ignored the ProductVersion key and used ProductKey instead. As of macOS Monterey, the ProductVersion key will be supported on macOS. iOS already uses this key to specify updates. For compatibility, if you specify both ProductVersion and ProductKey, then ProductKey will be used. If the device can't find an update eligible for that version, it will send the appropriate response. This removes the round trip for minor OS updates as long as you have previously collected the supported device ID of the device. MDM administrators can automatically install and authorize software updates for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, as long as the device is supervised. In macOS 11 or later, all Mac computers enrolled using either Device Enrollment or Automated Device Enrollment are supervised. For iOS and iPadOS, the user will be required to enter their passcode to proceed with the update. Mac computers with Apple silicon introduce the concept of \"ownership.\" Ownership can loosely be defined as the user who has first claimed a Mac for configuring it for their use and is not tied to true legal ownership or chain of custody. Ownership defines who is authorized to make changes to the startup security policy for a specific install of macOS. On Apple silicon, the startup security policy defines the restrictions around which versions of macOS can boot on Mac computers and permission to use the bootstrap token for automated updates. macOS requires authentication to perform updates. For Mac computers with Apple silicon, authentication requires a user password or an MDM bootstrap token. A user password is required for user-initiated, interactive updates through System Preferences. An MDM Bootstrap Token is used for automated non-interactive updates, which requires macOS 11.2 or later, and the update being installed must be signed by Apple. New in macOS Monterey, we have introduced support for the bootstrap token for MDM-initiated install-later flows. This means that Apple silicon devices can schedule and perform updates at a later time, when the device is not in use. Your users will appreciate that you're updating their device while not disrupting their workflow. They can just wake up the next day to an updated machine. If you're already supporting the bootstrap token, this will just start working when you use the InstallLater action in ScheduleOSUpdate. Once the MDM knows which update is applicable to devices, the ScheduleOSUpdate command is used to deploy the update to macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Just note, an MDM command can be used to install the update during the deferral window or after. There are several options when using the ScheduleOSUpdate command. One option that must be set is the install action, whose value significantly affects the behavior of the update. The InstallASAP install action is the primary update mechanism for userless macOS devices. InstallASAP uses the bootstrap token for authentication on Mac computers with Apple silicon. This action performs immediately, with an option for a user to cancel the update. Just note that InstallASAP command does not automatically close applications that are actively in use unless the InstallForceResart option is used.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Matt Ricketson: Welcome to “What’s New in SwiftUI.” I’m Matt, and later on, I’ll be joined by Taylor. This session is all about SwiftUI, Apple’s declarative UI framework. SwiftUI is still young, but we’ve come so far already. SwiftUI was first released in 2019, introducing a powerful new way to build user interfaces in a declarative, state-driven style. We took the next big step with SwiftUI’s second release, enabling 100 percent SwiftUI apps with the new App and Scene APIs. This year we’re focused on supporting even deeper adoption of SwiftUI in your apps with a great set of rich new features. Now if you haven’t yet had a chance to try out SwiftUI yourself, that’s OK! Only you know what’s best for your app. But here are a few tips to keep in mind as you learn about all the new features available this year. A good way to dip your toes into SwiftUI is to use it to create brand-new features in an existing app, like how it powers the new activity stream in Notes for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Or the new avatar picker in macOS, also built with SwiftUI. Remember, you can mix in SwiftUI alongside your existing UIKit or AppKit code. SwiftUI is also a useful tool for expanding your app to new platforms, like how SwiftUI was used to build the new Shortcuts app on macOS. With SwiftUI, you can easily share common code between platforms while still crafting a unique experience for each device. And when you’re ready to redesign your app, that’s the perfect time to bring in SwiftUI to help. The all-new Apple Pay purchase flow was redesigned using SwiftUI, which was also used to bring a fresh coat of paint to the new Help Viewer on macOS and the Tips app on watchOS. And finally, we can’t forget the gorgeous new Weather app for iOS, also rebuilt from the ground up in SwiftUI. These are just several examples of how SwiftUI is helping build the next generation of apps. For this session, we’d like to share some of the great new APIs that made it all possible. We’ll start by walking through improvements to how we build collections of content with lists and grids. Next, we’ll go beyond lists, introducing new features to take your data-driven apps to the next level. Third, we’ll show off some stunning new tools for driving graphics and visual effects. We’ll talk about enhancements to text, keyboards, and focus-based navigation. And finally, we’ll give some love to buttons. So let’s dive in, beginning with lists and grids, which are critical features for organizing and displaying data within SwiftUI apps. This year, we’re making it even easier to write rich, interactive lists and grids. Let’s start with a fun one. SwiftUI now has built-in support for loading images asynchronously. SwiftUI makes loading these images feel easy with the new AsyncImage view. Just give it a URL, and SwiftUI will automatically fetch and display the remote image for you, and even provide a default placeholder. AsyncImage can also be customized. For example, we can add modifiers to the loaded image and also define custom placeholders, like I’m doing here to add some fun colors. We can even add custom animations and error handling! And AsyncImage is available on all platforms. We hope you check it out. AsyncImage loads its content immediately, but sometimes your app needs to load content on-request, like when showing a feed. This is a great use case for supporting pull-to-refresh on iOS and iPadOS, using the new refreshable modifier. This modifier configures a refresh action and passes down through the environment. Lists on iOS and iPadOS use this action to automatically add pull-to-refresh, but you can also use it to build your own custom refresh behaviors. You may have noticed this new await keyword, which is one of the new concurrency language features in Swift 5.5. This indicates that the updateItems method is an async action, which lets us refresh our list without blocking the UI. Another new concurrency-related SwiftUI feature is the task modifier. This API lets you attach an async task to the lifetime of your view. That means the task will kick off when the view first loads and automatically cancel itself when the view is removed. This is a great way for us to load the first batch of photos automatically. These new concurrency modifiers look simple on the surface, but can be used to build sophisticated async behaviors into your app. For example, here I’ve set up a task for loading the newest photos as they become available. I’ve written just a regular for loop, but you’ll notice the await keyword used here as well. That’s because newestCandidates is actually an async sequence, which is another new concurrency feature in Swift 5.5. This means we’ll wait for the newest candidate asynchronously, iterating the loop only when the next candidate is available. That means we’re actually packing a ton of functionality into just this single modifier. The view starts a task that listens for candidates asynchronously as soon as it appears, updating the list every time a new candidate becomes available and then automatically canceling the task when the view disappears, all without blocking our app’s UI. There’s a lot more to learn about Swift concurrency and how to take advantage of it in SwiftUI, so we’ve prepared a few other talks to dig into the details. “Discover concurrency in SwiftUI” will explain how concurrency relates to SwiftUI’s update model and demo some the new features we just discussed. And in “Swift concurrency: Update a sample app,” we walk you step by step through upgrading an existing project with async model code. Next up, we’re giving you new and better ways to build interactivity into your list content. In this example, I’ve written a simple list for sharing the directions to my super secret hideout. This looks nice, but the text isn’t editable. Let’s fix that. We can make text editable by swapping it out for a text field instead. However, a text field requires a binding to the text. Within our list’s content closure, we’re only given a plain value for each element in our collection, not a binding. In situations like this, it can be tricky to figure out how to get a binding to the collection element for each row. One common approach is to iterate over the indices of the collection instead, using a subscript to get a binding to the element at that index. However, this technique is not recommended, because SwiftUI will be forced to reload the entire list when anything changes. In fact, we’ve prepared a whole talk discussing this topic in much more detail. To learn more, I’d recommend watching “Demystify SwiftUI.” For now, let’s undo these changes and take a look at a better solution. This year, SwiftUI is providing a much easier way to get access to bindings for individual elements within a collection. Simply pass a binding to your collection into the list, using the normal dollar sign operator, and SwiftUI will pass back a binding to each individual element within the closure. Code that only needs to read the value can stay exactly the same as before, just like you’re used to. But now we can easily add interactive controls like a text field using the normal binding syntax that we’re used to, which means I can finally fill in the super secret door code I forgot to include earlier. This new syntax is part of the Swift language, so it works everywhere you would expect, not just lists. For example, we can use the same technique in a ForEach view within our list instead. And better yet, you can even back-deploy this code to any prior release supported by SwiftUI. But we’re not just making your existing code easier to write. Lists are gaining some great new features too! Let’s start with some new ways to visually customize your lists. With the new listRowSeparatorTint modifier, you can change the color of individual row separators, like I’ve done here to align the separator and icon colors for each row. SwiftUI also has an equivalent modifier for section separators. For this app though, all those separators seem a little distracting. I want my directions to feel like a single, unified flow. Maybe we should try removing them, which we can now do with the new listRowSeparator modifier, configuring our separators to be hidden. Now our directions feel much less cluttered. Let’s look at another app I’m making...",

There can be so many details that they're easy to forget and tedious to find the issues. A built-in checklist would be ideal. Some teams set up automated testing in a continuous integration system using technologies like Safari's WebDriver, available for macOS and now iOS. WebDriver is a great tool for catching code changes that break expected functionality for users. But for web developers who want to check that their in-progress work meets code expectations, Web Inspector now includes a new audit system available with Safari 13 on macOS that provides a quick, easy and more convenient way to check web content. In this video, I'll show you how to use audits in Web Inspector, how to work with tests and understand their results, and finally I'll cover how to create custom audits for your projects.

An App Clip is a small part of an app that can be launched at the moment when it's needed. It provides fast and focused experience on a specific task. User can easily upgrade to your app after they complete the task. Since it's launched, we have seen many great App Clips from developers all over the world. They are well designed, easily discoverable, with great ways to engage users. Let me share some examples with you. Firi Games has an App Clip for their popular Phoenix 2 game. I can go to their web site in Safari, tap the banner. It will show the App Clip Card for this game. From there, I can launch the game. In a couple seconds, the game's ready to play. After I play the first level, I can download the full game right from the App Clip. TikTok has an App Clip to make sharing video really fun and easy. When I receive a video from my friend, iMessage will show the TikTok App Clip preview. Tap of the preview shows the card. There I can open TikTok App Clip. I can enjoy the video right away. Panera bread is a U.S.-based food service with thousands of stores. If I look up one of the stores in Maps, the place card will show \"order food\" action button. I can open their App Clip right from there. Within seconds, the App Clip launches and shows the menu for this particular store. I can make order and pay with Apple Pay. In iOS 15, if I search a business in Spotlight, like Panera, the App Clip will show up in search results, too. With on-device intelligence, if I'm nearby Panera store, my phone can suggest the App Clip to me in Siri suggestion widget. Tap the suggestion, I can open it and order food right away. Honk created an App Clip for touchless payment for parking. All I need to do is scan their QR code attached at the parking lot. With one tap, I can open the App Clip and pay with Apple Pay. Primer AR Home Design has an App Clip for you to try paint, tile, and wallpaper in an AR environment. I can scan or tap the App Clip code on a tile to open the App Clip. There, I can experience how this beautiful tile would look like in my living room. These are some great example App Clips. There are many, many more. You can discovered them in Safari, Messages, or in the real world by a QR code, NFC tag, or App Clip code. I encourage you to try them out and see what App Clips can do. In this session, we will cover three topics. First, App Clip Card in Safari and SafariViewController. Then, we will talk about testing App Clip with local experiences. Last, we will cover App Clip code.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Hello, and welcome to WWDC. Ellie Epskamp-Hunt: Hi! My name is Ellie Epskamp-Hunt. I work on Safari. Today I'm going to introduce a new type of Safari extension, Safari web extensions. Before I go into more detail, let's cover Safari's existing extension ecosystem. First, there are content blockers. These are available for iOS and macOS and are designed for speed and user privacy. Safari 13.1 can even run your content blockers delivered with apps built with Mac Catalyst. Next up, share extensions. These are also available on both iOS and macOS. Once invoked by the user, they're able to run JavaScript on the web page and return data to your app extension. And third, Safari app extensions available on Mac OS. These are great if you are a native app developer already familiar with Swift or Objective-C who wants to extend your app's functionality into Safari. These extensions are all built using native technologies like Swift or Objective-C. But what if you aren't familiar with this style of development, but are instead a web developer familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Maybe you even have an extension written for another major web browser and you don't want to rewrite it in native code. This year we are thrilled to announce that Safari is adding support for web extensions on macOS. These are built primarily using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, similar to legacy Safari extensions, but this type of extension brings along significant improvements. You can use the same extension model and APIs that you're already familiar with in other browsers. And Web extensions also provide improved user privacy controls along with the ability to sell through the App Store. Today we're going to show you just how easy it is to bring your extensions from other browsers to Safari. We will walk you through using our conversion tool. We will review our privacy centric permissions model to show how users will grant capabilities to your extension. Finally we'll cover tips and tricks for debugging and show how to message your extension's native app. Before we create our first Safari web extension, let's talk about how these extensions are packaged. Just like other Safari extensions, Safari web extensions are packaged with native apps. When that native app is installed, the extension is also installed in Safari. It's up to you, the developer, if the containing app should play any role beyond this. The containing apps for Safari web extensions would be distributed through the App Store. And because these extensions are packaged with apps, you'll need to download Xcode 12 or higher to build and run that app. We've built a command line tool that ships with Xcode to help you convert existing extensions to use in Safari. This tool will package your extension into a native app. This tool only needs to be run once to create a default Xcode project using information from your extension's manifest file. That project will build and run the native app containing your extension. If there are keys that appear in your manifest that are not supported by the current version of Safari, the tool will let you know. The largest icon you declare in the manifest will be used as your app's icon. So you'll want to declare a larger icon size in your manifest. We recommend that you add a 512 by 512 icon and a 1024 by 1024 icon. For more information on designing great Mac app icons, check out the macOS Human Interface Guidelines. Finally, if you add more files while developing your extension, these new files must be added to your Xcode project -- and note that when you modify your source files through Xcode your changes will appear in the original file. Now let's see how this tool works in practice. I have my unconverted extension here. Sea Creator is an extension that replaces aquatic animal names and web pages with the corresponding emoji. This folder contains all of my extension's resources. In Terminal, I'll run the Safari web extension converter command and provide the path to the extension folder. Here it's asking if the information it gleaned from the manifest is correct. If I saw an issue with anything here, I could type \"no\" and the tool would allow me to make changes. But everything looks good, so I will press Enter to use the default option in the brackets, which is \"yes.\" We've got a warning from the tool. Let's minimize Xcode for a second.",

I think we have some really good stuff to talk to you about today, so we'll start with a brief introduction of where Core Bluetooth is right now. We'll talk about some of the enhanced reliability features that we built for this year. Talk about platform support. We announced watchOS support this year and we're really excited about that. A new feature for this year is L2CAP channels. Then we'll go over some of the best practices we've learned over the years, and finally we'll do a real world example of how to get the most out of Core Bluetooth. So I'd like to start with a brief introduction. Hopefully everybody knows but, if you don't, Core Bluetooth is our framework that we released in 2011 to interact with Bluetooth low energy peripherals and accessories. And since we initially shipped the framework, we've just seen amazing creativity come out of accessory manufacturers and app developers. We're so pleased to see what you've done with it. So when we started off, we knew that health and fitness and were going to be big areas. We've seen lots of things like smart scales, running sensors, fitness devices that you can wear all day. But the creativity has been awesome to watch. So things like toys and connected accessories for kids. We were really excited to see the Swift Playground's announcements this year, and really making things more interactive for children and people who are first learning to code. And we love seeing how easy it is for people to take things like sensors or buttons or switches and enable those through their apps and enable them wirelessly. And then things have gone in directions that we couldn't have even imagined. Things like connected goggles with head-mounted displays, just awesome creativity that's come out of this community. So I want to start this talk just by saying thank you.",

    "video_transcript": "Alexandre Morin: Hello, my name is Alexandre Morin, and I'm a senior consulting engineer supporting enterprise and education customers worldwide and sometimes just beyond. I specialize in device and content management and I'm excited to tell you about deploying iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 in your environment. iOS 15 brings new ways to stay connected, powerful tools to help you focus on tasks, exciting updates for Maps, and new privacy features improve transparency and give you more control over your data. With iPadOS 15, it's easier to get things done and find and organize information, and multitasking is also easier to use and discover. You can now place widgets among the apps on your Home screen and jot down a comment or idea on any app or screen with Quick Note. iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 also bring updates specifically for device management, which improve the way you deploy and manage devices in an education or enterprise environment. At WWDC 2021, a number of sessions brought you details on these updates and new capabilities. \"What's new in managing Apple devices\" is a great starting point for these sessions. My colleagues Graham and Nadia introduce you to the refreshed device management experience in Settings and essential new management controls like Managed Pasteboard. In this session, we'll go through fundamentals of deploying iOS and iPadOS devices at scale and a few new device management updates since WWDC 2021. The technology underlying all the management capabilities we will discuss today is Mobile Device Management, or MDM. It is a framework we made available to developers to create device management solutions. These solutions may differ in user interface and market focus, but they all work from the same set of Apple-defined APIs. The first key decisions when bringing iOS and iPadOS devices into your organization are the device ownership model and the connectivity options. Who owns the device has a big impact on the device management capabilities available to you. If you choose to purchase devices and provide them to your employees or students, you'll have the most complete set of management capabilities for those devices. You might choose to provide one to each user -- referred to as a one-to-one deployment -- or devices can be rotated among users, which is referred to as a shared deployment. If you're instead supporting user-owned devices, you'll have a more limited set of management capabilities that provide more control to the owner of the device. The second initial decision is the type of connectivity to provide to those devices. Whether the devices are organization-owned or user-owned, you may choose to provide cellular service for those devices in addition to Wi-Fi. You may even be interested in a private cellular network or an emergency services option. On iPad, providing cellular connectivity can transform the usage patterns of your employees or students, such as with the new iPad mini which supports 5G. When deploying cellular-enabled devices, you'll need to consider the type of SIM that will be used: a physical SIM or an eSIM. Unlike physical SIMs, which are easily removed and are prone to theft or loss, eSIMs are software based and can be locked on the device with an MDM restriction. They are also much easier to deploy at scale since they can be installed on hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of devices using MDM. This is much more efficient and cost-effective than physically inserting SIMs. Another advantage of eSIM technology is that you can use MDM to try out or change carriers in your environment without having to get new SIM cards and physical access to each device. Because of these benefits, eSIMs are ideal for deploying large numbers of cellular-enabled devices. Recent iPhone models support Dual SIM, which allows you to have two voice lines active at once. This could be a business and a personal line, or two business lines with different carriers for employees out in the field, like first responders or field workers. Typically, this is enabled with a physical SIM and an eSIM. iPhone 13 has support for dual eSIM, giving you even more flexibility in your cellular deployment. You can provision one or both for your users with MDM or let users manage one of those two eSIMs as their needs change. Once you've selected an ownership model and device connectivity options, you need to deploy and manage these devices. Since all aspects of your deployment will be driven by whether you or the user owns the device, we will cover those two scenarios separately. First let's review deploying devices that your organization has purchased and will provide to the employee or student. We will cover these four areas, which come together to form a great deployment strategy: enrollment, ongoing management, content, and redeployment. Let's start with enrollment for your organization-owned devices. The best enrollment experience for organization-owned devices is Automated Device Enrollment. It allows for zero-touch deployment workflows for your devices. Devices going through Automated Device Enrollment are automatically supervised, which gives you access to the entirety of the management options defined by Apple. This method allows you to customize enrollment based on your needs. You can display custom branding or consent text. You can also secure the device setup process using modern authentication services such as Azure AD, Okta, Ping, and others. Finally you can choose to skip some setup assistant screens including the screens shown after a software update -- which, I should note, will also skip those screens for any future software updates, a great feature for unattended devices like kiosks. Note that this is the only enrollment method that prevents users from removing management. This process is all enabled with a web-based portal called Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager. The devices you purchase from Apple or authorized resellers appear there and can be automatically assigned to your MDM server. When your devices are unboxed and activated, this portal will instruct them to enroll to your MDM and apply the enrollment settings you define in MDM. If you have devices that you acquired outside of Apple or authorized resellers, you can manually add iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV devices to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager with Apple Configurator 2 on Mac. When manually adding devices, there is a 30-day provisional period during which the user may opt out and remove the device from management. After the 30 days expire, the device is permanently added. Once the devices are in Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager, they'll follow enrollment settings that you've defined in your MDM. A one-to-one device will typically be set up by the end user right out of the box. This is where the ability to skip specific setup assistant screens makes the setup smoother for the user. After selecting language and country, enrollment to MDM is integrated right into the familiar setup assistant experience. For a device that will rotate between users, you may use enrollment settings to enable Shared iPad. This feature enables you to provide a personalized experience to each student or employee who uses the shared device, much like they would have on a one-to-one device. For all deployment types, Apple Configurator 2 helps to make initial device-provisioning operations smoother and faster. You can provision dozens of devices at a time without ever having to touch the glass. If you do not have access to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager in your area, there is an alternative to Automated Device Enrollment which is called Device Enrollment. It can allow you to still be able to deploy the devices you own in a strongly managed way. To achieve this, you use Apple Configurator 2 to enable supervision on your devices over USB and use Device Enrollment to enroll them to MDM. Both can be done as a single operation with Apple Configurator 2. You will not benefit from the lock MDM feature that comes with Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager enrollments, but you will still benefit from most of the features we're reviewing. Now that devices you own are enrolled, let's talk about ongoing management. As we discussed earlier, MDM management is built right into the operating system of every iOS and iPadOS device. The Settings app makes it clear to both your users and yourself as to the management state of the device and what MDM capabilities are in use. Those capabilities can be classified as payloads, restrictions, tasks, or queries. Configuration profiles consist of payloads that load settings and authorization information onto Apple devices. This automates the configuration of settings, accounts, restrictions, and credentials. With these different payload types, you can enforce passcode policies, restrict access to the Camera in sensitive environments, or deploy custom fonts. Mail, Contacts, and Calendar account information can be configured for users. Network information like Wi-Fi and VPN can be set up for your devices, as well as the certificates required for those connections. Some of the most important MDM payloads for your deployments are restrictions. They allow you to enforce your security policies and help users stay focused on their task. Commonly used restrictions allow you to lock device names, disable iCloud services or the App Store, which prevents users from installing third-party apps. But even then, you are still able to deploy apps with MDM. You can even hide or show any apps you want on the Home screen, be they third-party apps or most system apps. At WWDC we announced a new restriction called Managed Pasteboard that supplements Managed Open In. Managed Open In prevents attachments or documents from managed sources from being accidentally opened in unmanaged destinations and vice versa. For example, a confidential email attachment is not allowed to be opened in a user's personal apps. And mirroring that behavior, you may also prevent their personal document from accidentally entering the organizational data stream. We announced iCloud Private Relay at WWDC as a way to enhance user privacy and help users' traffic stay private. And new since WWDC, we introduced a supervised restriction to allow you to disable iCloud Private Relay on your devices. At the time, we also let network administrators know that they could restrict this feature by returning a negative DNS response for mask.icloud.com. Since then, we added a second host: mask-h2.icloud.com. Let's detail a few more helpful restriction examples. Managing USB pairing is important for securing access to a device over a physical connection but also to allow access for IT tasks like gathering logs. Historically, IT admins have used an enrollment setting to prevent any connections of USB. This method is deprecated and there is a more modern and flexible method available to you: the supervised allowHostPairing restriction. With this restriction in place, only computers that possess the same supervision identity as your iOS and iPadOS devices will be allowed access over USB. The main advantage to this method is that you do not need to restore devices to change these settings. If you need access, you're not locked out. Finally, you've likely already had users ask for help in clearing their device passcode after they forgot it. If the user has restarted their Wi-Fi-only device since the last time they successfully unlocked it, the Wi-Fi credentials remain encrypted, the device is off-network, and MDM cannot reach it to send a clear passcode command. An Ethernet adapter can be quite useful in this scenario. If you have previously disabled USBRestrictedMode, the Ethernet connection will be active at this stage and the clear passcode command will reach the device successfully. This is one example of weighing the security benefits of a restriction versus the related support considerations. Sometimes full lockdown can be detrimental. A device enrolled in MDM can also be administered through a number of direct management tasks, giving you powerful remote capabilities. Management task can take specific actions on devices like installing apps, remotely wiping a device, or installing a software update. Tasks to highlight here are Lost Mode and Activation Lock. For locating lost or misplaced devices, you have Managed Lost Mode. You use MDM to place a device directly in Lost Mode. During this time, MDM can collect location information for the device or make it emit an audible alert. The device is locked with a customized message with contact information for your organization, so anyone finding the device is aware that it is being tracked. And after MDM takes the device out of Lost Mode, the Lock Screen displays a message informing the user that this device has been geolocated and when. Most importantly, Lost Mode does not require the user to use iCloud or to grant access to Location Services. Actually, Location Services can be turned off and Lost Mode will still work. The privacy notifications of Lost Mode strike a balance between user privacy and IT control. Theft deterrence is made easy for Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager devices with device-based Activation Lock. By leveraging device-based Activation Lock, MDM enables or disables Activation Lock directly with Apple's servers without the need to interact with the device or a user's iCloud account. For devices you own, you should use this exclusively and not allow users to Activation Lock your devices with their iCloud account. If you do let users leverage user-based Activation Lock, MDM can still gather a bypass code and use it to clear Activation Lock with a command sent to the device. MDM can query your managed devices so you can check their status and ensure they meet your compliance standards. The inventory updates sent to your MDM enable you to get the name of your devices, which can also be remotely set and locked. Battery level data can help you get a sense of your user's ability to get all-day battery life, and roaming status can help alert you to potentially costly cellular charges. And of course, compliance through passcode requirements helps ensure that your devices and data are secured with data protection. Many of your device management goals are achieved when your MDM solution combines a set of restrictions, queries, and tasks, such as in the critical case of managing and deploying software updates. In \"Manage software updates in your organization\" my colleague Lucy covered software update management. Let's review and add a few additional details as you prepare to deploy iOS 15. When a beta software update is released, you use AppleSeed for IT to obtain it and test it in your environment. AppleSeed for IT is a great way to access IT-specific release notes and test plans and file direct feedback. Learn more about AppleSeed for IT in a WWDC 2020 session. If you require more time to validate the software update in your environment than the beta cycle, you can defer updates for up to 90 days. On iOS and iPadOS, all updates have the same deferral value applied to them. Deferral means that updates that would otherwise be shown to the user in Settings are instead hidden until the deferral window expires. Deferral does not affect the ability to update a device using MDM commands, Apple Configurator 2, or the macOS Finder. You can use MDM to install the latest OS or a specific OS version on your supervised devices, even while the deferred update is hidden from the user. And new since WWDC 2021, you can now defer beta updates to test your deferral workflow during the beta cycle instead of needing to wait for a public release. When you're ready to update devices and you send an MDM install command, the device prompts the user with the update and describes it as required by your organization. All updates sent by MDM are treated as required updates and can only be delayed by the user up to three times. After the third time the user delays, the device will require the user to update in order to continue to use the device with the exception of emergency calling. Any update on a device with a passcode requires the user to enter it for authorization. Starting with iOS and iPadOS 15, users running iOS and iPadOS 14.5 and later may now see the option to choose between two software update versions. This allows users to update to the latest version of iOS and iPadOS 15 as soon as it is released. Or they can continue on iOS and iPadOS 14 and still get important security updates. The choices will be available for a period of time. MDM can control which options are offered with the new RecommendationCadence key in the Settings command. And of course, these update options will respect the software update deferral window you have set. With a RecommendationCadence of 0, the user is presented with the option to update to iOS 14 or iOS 15 releases. With a RecommendationCadence of 1, the user is only presented the option to update to iOS 14 releases. And with a RecommendationCadence of 2, the user is only presented the option to update to iOS 15 releases. In each case, any deferral policy you set is respected. While your MDM solution works to add support for these update options, you may also be able to send a custom command provided here to set the RecommendationCadence on your devices. I mentioned Shared iPad before and wanted to give you a little more detail on what to consider when enabling Shared iPad. Users sign in with the Managed Apple ID that you create in Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager, If you're an education organization, you can sync with your student information system to automatically create the Managed Apple IDs, or if you use Azure Active Directory, you can federate to leverage existing credentials. For users without credentials, temporary session provides them a way to log into Shared iPad and leave no data behind. Shared iPad works with content caching, which we'll describe soon when we review getting content on the device. You can also use tethered caching where a Mac is providing content caching and Ethernet connectivity over USB to a cart of Shared iPad devices, offloading your Wi-Fi network from app and iPad OS update traffic. Now that your devices are enrolled and managed, let's look at deploying content. You'll provide apps and books to your employees or students using Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager, where you obtain content licenses. You can purchase licenses for third-party App Store apps, books from Apple Books, and custom apps. Custom apps are made specifically for you by internal or external developers, only you can purchase them in Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager, and these apps are hosted by Apple but they're not available to the general public. Apple provides both device-based and user-based app distribution. For organization-owned devices, you should use device-based app distribution. Once you acquire the licenses, you use MDM to assign and distribute apps directly to a device. This does not require you to configure an Apple ID on each device or send an invitation to each user. You maintain full ownership of the app licenses and can revoke them from the device and reassign them to different devices.",

    "video_transcript": "Hi, I'm Victoria. I'm an engineer on the Documentation Tools team here at Apple, and together with my colleague Ethan, we're going to give you an introduction to the new documentation features in Xcode 13. There are new ways to read and write documentation that both fit right into your workflow and unlock new possibilities for your development. Xcode 13 has new features to build, write, and browse documentation for Swift frameworks and packages. This unlocks a powerful mode of documentation-driven development where you can read all about your Swift dependencies while you write your code. This documentation lives right alongside the platform libraries in the Developer Documentation window right in Xcode. In this session, we'll give an overview of the documentation features in Xcode 13, walk you through building documentation for the Swift frameworks and packages you're writing and using, show you how you can use Xcode 13 to write great documentation, and finish up by showing off the ways you can share documentation with Xcode 13. Let's get started with why I'm personally excited about the new documentation features. I'm sure we've all been there. There's some new framework or package that we want to use, but when it comes time to integrate it into our code, we need to figure out what all comes in it. This is where Xcode 13 steps in. Now Xcode comes with a compiler for your documentation as well as your code, and you can build and view documentation for Swift frameworks and packages all inside Xcode. We call it DocC, and we've integrated it all throughout Xcode to enhance the way you read and write documentation. Now, DocC is more than just a documentation compiler run after the fact. It's a fully integrated documentation environment that complements Xcode, offering a rich, live environment with your docs appearing in Quick Help, rich code completion to allow you to tie your docs together into a cohesive whole, full documentation available in the integrated Developer Documentation window, and an easy option to share pre-built documentation to view in Xcode and on the web, just to name a few. Stay tuned for our other DocC sessions at WWDC 2021, which will go over all these in detail and much more. DocC empowers you to write excellent reference documentation, leveraging the power of Xcode and Swift to give users a bird's-eye view of the public APIs in your framework or package, complete with the ability to describe how APIs work together, not just in isolation. DocC enables you to write much more than great reference documentation, though. There are two additional ways to write documentation with DocC that we're excited to show off this year. Articles allow you to walk users through the big picture behind your framework, giving you an opportunity to tie individual items in your framework together with a cohesive story. And tutorials are a powerful step-by-step walk-through of writing a project that uses your framework. They allow you to go much deeper than reference documentation or articles by giving your users a guided introduction to your framework from the ground up.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Courtland Idstrom: Hello, my name is Courtland Idstrom, and I'm an engineer on the RealityKit team. In this video, I'm going to show you how to use the new rendering features in RealityKit 2. RealityKit is a framework designed to make building AR apps simple and intuitive. Rendering is a key piece of RealityKit, centered around highly realistic, physically based rendering. Since our first release in 2019, we've been working on your feedback and we're shipping a major update to RealityKit. In the \"Dive into Reality Kit 2\" session, we covered the evolution of RealityKit, providing many enhancements -- from updates to the ECS system, more evolved material and animation capabilities, and generating audio and texture resources at runtime. To showcase these improvements, we built an app that turns your living room into an underwater aquarium. In this talk, we'll show some of the new rendering features that went into the app. RealityKit 2 provides control and flexibility with how objects are rendered, allowing you to create even better AR experiences. This year we bring advancements to our material system, enabling you to add your own materials by authoring custom Metal shaders. Custom post effects allow you to augment RealityKit's post effects with your own. New mesh APIs allow mesh creation, inspection, and modifications at runtime. Let's start with the most requested feature in RealityKit 2, support for custom shaders. RealityKit's rendering centers around a physically based rendering model. Its built-in shaders make it easy to create models that look natural next to real objects across a range of lighting conditions. This year, we're building on these physically based shaders and exposing the ability for you to customize the geometry and surface of models using shaders. The first of our shader APIs is geometry modifier. A geometry modifier is a program, written in the Metal Shading Language, that gives you the opportunity to change the vertices of an object every frame as it's rendered on the GPU. This includes moving them and customizing their attributes, such as color, normal, or UVs. It's run inside of RealityKit's vertex shader, and is perfect for ambient animation, deformation, particle systems, and billboards. Our seaweed is a great example of ambient animation. The seaweed is moving slowly due to the movement of water around it. Let's take a closer look. Here you can see the wireframe of the seaweed as created by our artist; this shows the vertices and triangles comprising the mesh. We're going to write a shader program that executes on each vertex to create our motion. We'll use a sine wave, a simple periodic function, to create movement. We're simulating water currents so we want nearby vertices to behave similarly, regardless of their model's scale or orientation. For this reason, we use the vertex's world position as an input to the sine function. We include a time value as well, so that it moves over time. Our first sine wave is in the Y dimension to create up-down movement. To control the period of the motion, we'll add a spatial scale. And we can control the amount of its movement with an amplitude. We'll apply the same function to the X and Z dimensions so it moves in all three axes. Now, let's look at the model as a whole. One thing we haven't yet accounted for: vertices close to the base of the stalk have very little room for movement, while ones at the top have the highest freedom to move. To simulate this, we can use the vertex's y-coordinate relative to the object's origin as a scaling factor for all three axes, which gives us our final formula. Now that we have a plan for our shader, let's take a look at where to find these parameters. Geometry parameters are organized into a few categories. The first is uniforms, values that are the same for every vertex of the object within one frame. We need time for our seaweed. Textures contain all textures authored as part of the model, plus an additional custom slot, which you can use as you see fit. Material constants have any parameters, such as tint or opacity scale, authored with the object or set via code. Geometry contains some read-only values, such as the current vertex's model position or vertex ID. We need both model and world positions for our seaweed movement. Geometry also has read-write values, including normal, UVs, and model position offset. Once we have computed our offset, we'll store it here to move our vertices. Let's dive into Metal shader. We start out by including RealityKit.h. Now we declare a function with the visible function attribute. This instructs the compiler to make it available separately from other functions. The function takes a single parameter, which is RealityKit's geometry_parameters. We'll retrieve all values through this object. Using the geometry member of params, we'll ask for both the world position and model position. Next we calculate a phase offset, based on the world position at the vertex and time. Then we apply our formula to calculate this vertex's offset. We store the offset on geometry, which will get added to the vertex's model position. We have our geometry modifier, but it's not yet hooked up to our seaweed. Let's switch to our ARView subclass, written in Swift. We start by loading our app's default Metal library, which contains our shader. Next we construct a geometryModifier using our shader's name and library. For each material on the seaweed, we create a new custom material. We pass the existing material as the first parameter to CustomMaterial, so that it inherits the textures and material properties from the base material while adding our geometry modifier. It looks pretty nice! Since we're underwater, we've kept the animation pretty slow. By tweaking amplitude and phase, the same effect can be extended to grass, trees, or other foliage. Now that we've shown how to modify geometry, let's talk about shading. This is our octopus from the underwater scene, looking great with our built-in shader. As they do, our octopus transitions between multiple looks. The second look has a reddish color. Our artist has authored two base color textures, one for each look. In addition to the color change, the red octopus has a higher roughness value, making it less reflective. And, to make our octopus even more special, we wanted to create a nice transition between looks. Here you can see the transition in action. Mesmerizing. While each look can be described as a physically based material, for the transition itself, we need to write a surface shader. So what is a surface shader? A surface shader allows you to define the appearance of an object. It runs inside the fragment shader for every visible pixel of an object. In addition to color, this includes surface properties such as normal, specular, and roughness. You can write shaders that enhance an object's appearance or replace it entirely, creating new effects. We've seen the two base-color textures for our octopus. For the transition effect, our artist has encoded a special texture for us. This texture is actually a combination of three different layers. There's a noise layer on top creating localized transition patterns. We have a transition layer, which dictates the overall movement, starting at the head and moving towards the tentacles. And there's a mask layer for areas that we don't want to change color, such as the eye and underside of the tentacles. These three layers are combined into the red, green, and blue channels of our texture, which we assign to the custom texture slot. With our textures set up, let's look at how to access these from a surface shader. Similar to the geometry modifier, the surface shader has access to uniforms, textures, and material constants. Time is an input to our octopus transition. We'll sample textures authored with our model and read material constants, allowing our artist to make model-wide adjustments. Geometry -- such as position, normal, or UVs -- appear in a geometry structure. These are the interpolated outputs from the vertex shader. We'll use UV0 as our texture coordinate. A surface shader writes a surface structure. Properties start with default values, and we're free to calculate these values in any way we see fit. We'll be calculating base color and normal. Then, four surface parameters: roughness, metallic, ambient occlusion, and specular. Now that we know where our values live, let's start writing our shader. We'll do this in three steps. First calculate the transition value, where 0 is a fully purple octopus and 1 is fully red. Using the transition value, we'll calculate color and normal and then fine-tune by assigning material properties. Let's get started. First step: transition. We're building the octopus surface function, which takes a surface_parameters argument. Since we're using textures, we declare a sampler. On the right, you can see what our octopus looks like with an empty surface shader -- it's gray and a little bit shiny. RealityKit puts you in complete control of what does or does not contribute to your model's appearance. In order to compute color, there's a few things we need to do first. We'll store some convenience variables. We access our UV0, which we'll use as a texture coordinate. Metal and USD have different texture coordinate systems, so we'll invert the y-coordinate to match the textures loaded from USD. Now we'll sample our transition texture -- the three-layered texture our artist created. Our artist set up a small function that takes the mask value plus time, and returns 0 to 1 values for blend and colorBlend. Second step: color and normal. With our previously computed blend variable, we can now calculate the octopus's color and see the transition. To do this, we sample two textures: the base color and the secondary base color, which we've stored in emissive_color. Then we blend between the two colors using the previously computed colorBlend. We'll multiply by base_color_tint -- a value from the material -- and set our base color on the surface. Next we'll apply the normal map, which adds surface deviations, most noticeable on the head and tentacles. We sample the normal map texture, unpack its value, and then set on the surface object. Onto material properties. Here's our octopus so far, with color and normal. Let's see how surface properties affect its look. Roughness, which you'll see on the lower body; ambient occlusion, which will darken up the lower portions; and specular, which gives us a nice reflection on the eye and some additional definition on the body. Let's add these to our shader. We sample four textures on the model, one for each property. Next we scale these values with material settings. In addition, we're also increasing the roughness as we transition from purple to red. Then we set our four values on the surface. Similar to before, we need to apply the shader to our model. We assign this material to our model in our ARView subclass. First we load our two additional textures, then load our surface shader. Like before, we're constructing new materials from the object's base material, this time with a surface shader and our two additional textures. And we're done. So to recap, we've shown the seaweed animation using geometry modifiers and how to build an octopus transition with surface shaders. While we've demonstrated them separately, you can combine the two for even more interesting effects. Moving on to another highly requested feature, support for adding custom post processing effects. RealityKit comes with a rich suite of camera-matched post effects like motion blur, camera noise, and depth of field. These effects are all designed to make virtual and real objects feel like they're part of the same environment. These are available for you to customize on ARView. This year, we're also exposing the ability for you to create your own fullscreen effects. This allows you to leverage RealityKit for photo realism, and add new effects to tailor the result for your app. So what is a post process? A post process is a shader or series of shaders that execute after objects have been rendered and lit. It also occurs after any RealityKit post effects. Its inputs are two textures: color and a depth buffer. The depth buffer is displayed as greyscale here; it contains a distance value for each pixel relative to the camera. A post process writes its results to a target color texture. The simplest post effect would copy source color into target color. We can build these in a few ways. Apple's platforms come with a number of technologies that integrate well with post effects, such as Core Image, Metal Performance Shaders, and SpriteKit. You can also write your own with the Metal Shading Language. Let's start with some Core Image effects. Core Image is an Apple framework for image processing. It has hundreds of color-processing, stylization, and deformation effects that you can apply to images and video. Thermal is a neat effect -- something you might turn on for an underwater fish finder. Let's see how easy it is to integrate with RealityKit. All of our post effects will follow the same pattern. You set render callbacks, respond to prepare with device, and then post process will be called every frame. Render callbacks exist on RealityKit's ARView. We want both the prepareWithDevice and postProcess callbacks. Prepare with device will be called once with the MTLDevice. This is a good opportunity to create textures, load compute or render pipelines, and check device capabilities. This is where we create our Core Image context. The postProcess callback is invoked each frame. We'll create a CIImage, referencing our source color texture. Next we create our thermal filter. If you're using a different Core Image filter, this is where you'd configure its other parameters. Then we create a render destination, which targets our output color texture and utilizes the context's command buffer. We ask Core Image to preserve the image's orientation and start the task. That's it! With Core Image, we've unlocked hundreds of prebuilt effects that we can use. Now let's see how we can use Metal Performance Shaders to build new effects. Let's talk about bloom. Bloom is a screen space technique that creates a glow around brightly lit objects, simulating a real-world lens effect. Core Image contains a bloom effect, but we're going to build our own so we can control every step of the process. We'll build the effect with Metal Performance Shaders, a collection of highly optimized compute and graphics shaders. To build this shader, we're going to construct a graph of filters using color as the source. We first want to isolate the areas that are bright. To do this, we use an operation called \"threshold to zero.\" It converts color to luminance and sets every pixel below a certain brightness level to 0. We then blur the result using a Gaussian blur, spreading light onto adjacent areas. Efficient blurs can be challenging to implement and often require multiple stages. Metal Performance Shaders handles this for us. Then we add this blurred texture to the original color, adding a glow around bright areas. Let's implement this graph as a post effect. We start by creating an intermediate bloomTexture. Then execute our ThresholdToZero operation, reading from sourceColor and writing to bloomTexture. Then we perform a gaussianBlur in place. Finally, we add our original color and this bloomed color together. That's it! Now that we've seen a couple ways to create post effects, let's talk about a way to put effects on top of our output using SpriteKit. SpriteKit is Apple's framework for high performance, battery-efficient 2D games. It's perfect for adding some effects on top of our 3D view. We'll use it to add some bubbles on the screen as a post effect, using the same prepareWithDevice and postProcess callbacks. We have the same two steps as before. In prepareWithDevice, we'll create our SpriteKit renderer and load the scene containing our bubbles. Then in our postProcess callback, we'll copy our source color to target color, update our SpriteKit scene, and render on top of the 3D content. prepareWithDevice is pretty straightforward -- we create our renderer and load our scene from a file. We'll be drawing this over our AR scene, so we need our SpriteKit background to be transparent. In postProcess, we first blit the source color to the targetColorTexture; this will be the background that SpriteKit renders in front of. Then advance our SpriteKit scene to the new time so our bubbles move upward. Set up a RenderPassDescriptor and render onto it. And that's it! We've shown how to utilize existing frameworks to make post effects, but sometimes you really do need to make one from scratch. You can also author a full-screen effect by writing a compute shader. For our underwater demo, we needed a fog effect that applies to virtual objects and camera passthrough. Fog simulates the scattering of light through a medium; its intensity is proportional to the distance. To create this effect, we needed to know how far each pixel is from the device. Fortunately, ARKit and RealityKit both provide access to depth information. For LiDAR-enabled devices, ARKit provides access to sceneDepth, containing distances in meters from the camera. These values are extremely accurate at a lower resolution than the full screen. We could use this depth directly but it doesn't include virtual objects, so they wouldn't fog correctly. In our postProcess, RealityKit provides access to depth for virtual content and -- when scene understanding is enabled -- approximated meshes for real-world objects. The mesh builds progressively as you move, so it contains some holes where we haven't currently scanned. These holes would show fog as if they were infinitely far away. We'll combine data from these two depth textures to resolve this discrepancy. ARKit provides depth values as a texture. Each pixel is the distance, in meters, of the sampled point. Since the sensor is at a fixed orientation on your iPhone or iPad, we'll ask ARKit to construct a conversion from the sensor's orientation to the current screen orientation, and then invert the result. To read virtual content depth, we need a little bit of info about how RealityKit packs depth. You'll notice that, unlike ARKit's sceneDepth, brighter values are nearer to the camera. Values are stored in a 0 to 1 range, using an Infinite Reverse-Z Projection. This just means that 0 means infinitely far away, and 1 is at the camera's near plane. We can easily reverse this transform by dividing the near plane depth by the sampled depth. Let's write a helper function to do this. We have a Metal function taking the sample's depth and projection matrix. Pixels with no virtual content are exactly 0. We'll clamp to a small epsilon to prevent divide by zero. To undo the perspective division, we take the last column's z value and divide by our sampled depth. Great! Now that we have our two depth values, we can use the minimum of the two as an input to our fog function. Our fog has a few parameters: a maximum distance, a maximum intensity at that distance, and a power curve exponent. The exact values were chosen experimentally. They shape our depth value to achieve our desired fog density. Now we're ready to put the pieces together. We have our depth value from ARKit, a linearized depth value from RealityKit, and a function for our fog. Let's write our compute shader. For each pixel, we start by sampling both linear depth values. Then we apply our fog function using our tuning parameters, which turns linear depth into a 0 to 1 value. Then we blend between source color and the fog color, depending on fogBlend's value, storing the result in outColor. To recap, RealityKit's new post process API enables a wide range of post effects. With Core Image, we've unlocked hundreds of ready-built effects. You can easily build new ones with Metal Performance Shaders, add screen overlays with SpriteKit, and write your own from scratch with Metal. For more information about Core Image or Metal Performance Shaders, see the sessions listed. Now that we've covered rendering effects, let's move onto our next topic, dynamic meshes. In RealityKit, mesh resources store mesh data. Previously, this opaque type allowed you to assign meshes to entities. This year, we're providing the ability to inspect meshes, create, and update meshes at runtime. Let's look at how we can add special effects to the diver. In this demo, we want to show a spiral effect where the spiral contours around the diver. You can also see how the spiral is changing its mesh over time to animate its movement. Let's have a look at how to create this using our new mesh APIs. The effect boils down into three steps. We use mesh inspection to measure the model by examining its vertices. We then build a spiral, using the measurements as a guide. And finally, we can update the spiral over time. Starting with mesh inspection. To explain how meshes are stored, let's look at our diver model. In RealityKit, the Diver's mesh is represented as a mesh resource. With this year's release, MeshResource now contains a member called Contents. There is where all of the processed mesh geometry lives. Contents contains a list of instances and models. Models contain the raw vertex data, while instances reference them and add a transform. Instances allow the same geometry to be displayed multiple times without copying the data. A model can have multiple parts. A part is a group of geometry with one material. Finally, each part contains the vertex data we're interested in, such as positions, normals, texture coordinates, and indices. Let's first look at how we would access this data in code. We'll make an extension on MeshResource.Contents, which calls a closure with the position of each vertex. We start by going through all of the instances. Each of these instances map to a model. For each instance, we find its transform relative to the entity. We can then go into each of the model's parts and access the part's attributes. For this function, we're only interested in position. We can then transform the vertex to the entity space position and call our callback. Now that we can visit the vertices, let's look at how we want to use this data. We'll section our diver into horizontal slices. For each slice, we'll find the bounding radius of our model, and do this for every slice. To implement this, we'll start by creating a zero-filled array with numSlices elements. We then figure out the bounds of the mesh along the y-axis to create our slices. Using the function we just created, for each vertex in the model, we figure out which slice it goes in and we update the radius with the largest radius for that slice. Finally, we return a Slices object containing the radii and bounds. Now that we've analyzed our mesh to know how big it is, let's look at how to create the spiral mesh. The spiral is a dynamically generated mesh. To create this mesh, we need to describe our data to RealityKit. We do this with a mesh descriptor. The mesh descriptor contains the positions, normals, texture coordinates, primitives, and material indices. Once you have a mesh descriptor, you can generate a mesh resource. This invokes RealityKit's mesh processor, which optimizes your mesh. It will merge duplicate vertices, triangulate your quads and polygons, and represent the mesh in the most efficient format for rendering. The result of this processing gives us a mesh resource, which we can assign to an entity. Note that normals, texture coordinates, and materials are optional. Our mesh processor will automatically generate correct normals and populate them. As part of the optimization process, RealityKit will regenerate the topology of the mesh. If you need a specific topology, you can use MeshResource.Contents directly. Now that we know how creating a mesh works, let's look at how to create the spiral. To model the spiral, let's take a closer look at a section.",

There are lots of great workout apps already available in the App Store. Apple Watch is an amazing device capable of tracking all sorts of fitness activity. It can track distance and elevation on those challenging bike rides. You can monitor your heart rate and energy burned during intense workouts. For swimming, it can even detect stroke type and count laps. All of this and more is available for you to build a great workout app. Let’s take a look at what we will be covering today. This session is a Code-Along. We'll go over what that means and how you can participate. We'll build our workout views in SwiftUI. Then, we'll integrate HealthKit to our views. We'll also show you how to support the Always On state. I'm excited, let's get started. This session is a code-along. We will build a workout app together from scratch. While you get your Xcode ready, let's cover a couple of concepts. What is a workout app? A workout app tracks fitness activity during a workout. A workout can be started with a single tap. While the workout is in session, live metrics are displayed, such as elapsed time, energy burned, heart rate, and distance. When the workout ends, a summary shows the metrics recorded for the workout. This is what we will build today. Let’s get started building our workout views. Let’s open Xcode and start a new project. Click Create a new Xcode project, watchOS, Watch App, click Next. Give your workout app a name, such as \"MyWorkouts\". Ensure Interface is SwiftUI, and language is Swift and click Next.

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Beatriz Magalhães: Hi, my name is Bea, and I'm a human interface designer on the Documentation team. My colleague Jack and I are going to talk about how to elevate your DocC documentation in Xcode. It’s now easier than ever to write and share great documentation. This year, we’ve integrated documentation for your Swift frameworks right into Xcode 13. In this session, we'll enhance the documentation of a framework we created: SlothCreator. You can use SlothCreator to catalog sloths you find in nature and to create new adorable virtual sloths. To make our existing documentation for this framework better, we'll go over what documentation page types are available in Xcode 13 and how to choose what's best for your content, how to organize the order of your APIs to tell a story about your framework, and how extensions can give you flexibility in how you write your documentation. I’ll start with a new Xcode feature: documentation page types. Xcode 13 has a brand-new feature called \"Documentation Catalog,\" which enables you to create three page types you can view on the documentation window or on the web: reference, articles, and tutorials. Each project is unique and has different needs, but it’s usually good to have a diverse set of documentation. Reference provides concise, in-depth information about individual APIs in your library. This allows you to add text descriptions, code snippets, and relationships between different symbols. This is the backbone of your documentation. Articles are pages with free-form content. They’re great at giving the big picture of how a framework works and explaining how to complete a specific task. They often connect the dots between different symbols. Tutorials are a step-by-step walk-through of a project that uses your framework. It's great to understand how a combination of symbols work together by implementing it in practice. Framework adopters of all proficiency levels can benefit from tutorials, but it’s worth noting this is also a very beginner-friendly format. In this session, we’ll focus on articles. To see information on reference and tutorials, check out these other WWDC sessions. Before I start enhancing my SlothCreator documentation, I’ll check out what’s new in the documentation window. Now, you can see all of the Apple technologies as well as your own documentation right there in the navigator. Now, I’ll check out the current state of my SlothCreator documentation. I have my SlothCreator Swift package open in Xcode. I'm going to click on Product and then Build Documentation to bring up my documentation window. Scrolling through my SlothCreator framework documentation, I see that all my symbols are already covered by reference here, which is great. However, if I approach this page from the perspective of someone who's never used this framework before, it's not clear at a glance what it does. I can use a top-level article to paint the big picture. Top-level articles have a concise summary sentence, an overview with content like images and code snippets, and on the bottom, a topics section with a few symbols you want to highlight. To add an article, I need to set up my project with a documentation catalog. The documentation catalog is a file in the Xcode navigator that contains all my documentation files. Moreover, it lets me write new page types. This makes documentation quick to access at a glance and makes it easier for me to prioritize documentation in my day-to-day workflow. To do this, I can right-click on the SlothCreator Sources directory, which contains the sources for our SlothCreator target, and select New File. Then, I’ll scroll through the list until I find Documentation Catalog. I’ll name it to match my framework target: SlothCreator. Xcode gives me a top-level article when I create a documentation catalog. I’ll rename it to \"SlothCreator\" both in the project navigator and in the markdown. Now, let’s get started on our article. You write articles using Markdown. First, I’m going to add a summary that describes what my framework does in one sentence. Next, I'll add more in-depth information under the Overview title about the main functionalities of SlothCreator: research, care, and visualization. Lastly, I’m going to add an image so developers know at a glance what they’re looking at. I’d recommend adding images that are 2x in resolution and either Dark Mode-compatible or have a Dark Mode alternative. Don’t forget to include the proper naming conventions for your files. First, the name of your file: \"sloth.\" Then, if your image is in Dark Mode, a tilde and the word \"dark.\" Then, @2x to describe the scale factor. And lastly, your image file format, which in this case is .png. Now that I made sure my images are the right size and are named correctly, I’m going to open Finder and drag my assets into the Resources folder of my documentation catalog.",

    "video_transcript": "Hello, everyone! Welcome to our WWDC21 session, \"Add support for Matter in your smart home app.\" I'm Selina from Home Engineering. Today, my colleague, Chris, Sagar, and I will walk you through the exciting features we've added this year for Matter support. As mentioned in Monday's keynote, Matter is a new standard for smart home accessories being developed by Apple and other industry leaders to ensure that all smart home accessories work together seamlessly moving forward. Its vision is to democratize home automation worldwide, making it possible for people to begin building smart homes, and then continue adding to them for years to come. The Matter protocol is being developed as an open source effort which leverages proven technologies, including HomeKit, ensuring that it will support the broadest amount of smart home devices, and then make it easy for manufacturers to begin integrating it into their products. Using Matter, smart home accessory manufacturers no longer need to support multiple protocols in parallel, truly simplifying the development effort of making a product and supporting it on an ongoing basis. It also gives app developers an opportunity to focus on developing the best app experience for their customers, without the burden to create and then maintain proprietary protocols. By creating such a unified protocol for accessories, customers can easily enjoy the conveniences of a smart home and then confidently bring products into their homes, knowing they will all work together. It will enable more accessories for people to choose from in stores, and then builders everywhere will be able to install them as standard into homes. Motivated by these, we would love our developers to be able to use Matter the soonest in your accessory and app development. We're glad to let you know that the support for Matter is coming in iOS, iPadOS, and in tvOS 15 as a developer preview. There are many great features that we would like to introduce to you today. First and then foremost, let's talk about how you can integrate with Matter accessories via HomeKit. Today, an accessory implementing the HomeKit Accessory Protocol integrates with Apple Home via the HomeKit framework. Over the years, we have built great features on top of HomeKit that provides full control and then management of HAP accessories. When we look at integrating Matter accessories with Apple Home, we naturally came to the conclusion that we could expand the responsibility of the HomeKit framework to support Matter as a parallel protocol. Architecturally, this means that a HomeKit calls into the open source Matter implementation, as known as CHIP framework, in order to communicate with Matter accessories. For your context, the earlier name for the Matter project was Connected Home over IP, or, in short, CHIP. That's why, throughout today's talk, you will still see the reference of CHIP, both in the open source project and our APIs. We expect to have updated naming for the APIs in a later release. Back to our main topic, the encapsulation provided by HomeKit allows all existing Apple Home features to begin working with Matter accessories seamlessly and immediately. For example, setting up a Matter accessory using identical flows to HAP accessory setup, controlling Matter accessories in Control Center with just one swipe down, and the great hands-free integration with Siri for Matter accessory status and then control across all your Apple devices. But HomeKit's responsibility isn't just to support first-party features. In fact, since day 1, we designed HomeKit with the vision that app developers should be able to leverage HomeKit to build creative and then delightful smart home apps for their customers, without the burden to implement communication protocols with accessories. This continues to be true with Matter accessories. Keep using existing APIs as you've been using in HomeKit. They will all just start working with Matter accessories, no code change needed. Let's take accessory setup as an example. This code shows how you could call the addAndSetupAccessories API in your HomeKit app today. With iOS 15 developer preview, the QR code scanner you invoke by this API will not only work for HAP QR codes, but also start recognizing Matter QR codes, providing your customers a familiar and a consistent experience for accessory setup. For a bit of fun, those of you who have been paying close attention to this year's Swift updates know that there's a shift underway in the world of Swift concurrency. We are glad to let you know that the same APIs you are used to can now be invoked via the new Swift async/await paradigm, as well. Besides setup, with iOS 15 developer preview, you will also be able to use existing HomeKit APIs to read and write Matter accessory states. Moreover, you will automatically get remote access and timely notifications for Matter accessories, and then be able to add and edit Matter accessories using scene and automation APIs, all in the same way as what you do with HAP accessories.",

I'm part of the Enterprise and Education team and I'm here to talk about existing app distribution methods for business and education customers and to introduce a new option for getting apps to your institutional customers. As a developer for business or education institutions, you have different audiences who use your apps. These could be company employees, affiliated partners, students and teachers, and the general public. Each of these audiences have different ways they get apps. Let's review the current app distribution options and what methods are available for each audience. If you're developing and distributing an app for a consumer audience, you publish the app in the App Store, and customers install it on their own personal devices. If you're building a general productivity app for consumers, students, teachers, and business professionals, the public App Store is how you'd distribute it. Now if you're building apps for institutional customers in the enterprise and education space, you have additional distribution options to consider. This audience could include company employees, school teachers, and students. You can still publish these apps to the App Store, like the productivity apps example. You can also make these apps available for private distribution, using custom apps or the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. Customers in this audience will use Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager to purchase apps on behalf of their employees and students and manage these apps on corporate or institutional devices using a Mobile Device Management -- or MDM -- solution.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Guoye Zhang: Hi, I'm Guoye. My coworker Zhenchao and I work on HTTP frameworks. I'm sure you've heard a lot about Swift concurrency by now. If you haven't, check out \"Meet async/await in Swift\". I'm going to jump into how async/await works with URLSession. What I like most about Swift concurrency is that it makes your code linear, concise, and it supports native Swift error handling. Networking is inherently asynchronous, and in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey we introduced a set of new APIs in URLSession for you to take advantage of Swift concurrency features. To show you our new APIs, here is an app we are working on to adopt async/await. It's a photo-sharing app just for dog lovers, and we can favorite these photos. Here is our existing code that fetches a dog photo. It's using the completionHandler-based convenience method on URLSession. The code seems straightforward, and it worked in my limited testing. However, it has at least three mistakes. Let's dive in. First, let's follow the control flow. We create a data task and resume it. Then once the task is done, we jump into the completion handler, we check the response, create an image, and that's where the control flow ends. Hm, we are jumping back and forth. What about threading? It is surprisingly complex for this small piece of code. We have three different execution contexts in total. The outmost layer runs on whatever thread or queue of the caller, URLSessionTask completionHandler runs on session's delegate queue, and the final completion handler runs on the main queue. Since the compiler cannot help us here, we have to use extreme caution to avoid any threading issues such as data races. Now, I noticed something wrong. The calls to the completionHandler are not consistently dispatched to the main queue. This could be a bug. Also, we are missing an early return here. The completionHandler can be called twice if we got an error. This could violate assumptions made by the caller. Finally, this might not be very obvious, but UIImage creation can fail. If the data is in an incorrect format, this UIImage initializer returns nil, so we would have called the completionHandler with both nil image and nil error. This is likely not expected. Now this is the new version using async/await. Wow, it's so much simpler! The control flow is linear from top to bottom, and we know that everything in this function runs in the same concurrency context, so we no longer need to worry about threading issues. Here, we used the new async data method on URLSession. It suspends the current execution context without blocking, and it returns data and response on successful completion, or throws an error. We also used the throw keyword to throw errors when the response is unexpected. This allows the caller to catch and handle the error using Swift native error handling. Lastly, the compiler would bark if we try to return an optional UIImage from this function, so it essentially forces us to handle nil correctly. Here are the signatures of the methods we just used to fetch data from the network. URLSession.data methods accept either a URL or a URLRequest. They are equivalent to existing data task convenience methods. We also provide upload methods where you can upload data or upload a file. They are equivalent to existing upload task convenience methods. Be sure to set the correct HTTP method before sending the request since the default method GET does not support upload. Download methods store the response body as a file rather than in memory. Different from download task convenience methods, these new methods do not automatically delete the file, so don't forget to do so yourself. In this example, we are moving the file to a different location for further processing. Swift concurrency's cancellation works with URLSession async methods. One way to cancel is to use a concurrency Task.Handle. Here, we call async to create a concurrency Task loading two resources one by one. Later, we can use the Task.Handle to cancel its current running operation. Please note that concurrency Task is unrelated to URLSessionTask, even though they share the name \"Task.\" The methods we just talked about -- data, upload, download -- wait for the entire response body to arrive before returning. What if we want to receive the response body incrementally? I'm happy to introduce URLSession.bytes methods. They return when the response headers have been received and deliver the response body as an AsyncSequence of bytes. To show you how it works, my colleague Zhenchao will demo how he's adopting it in the Dogs app. Zhenchao Li: Thanks, Guoye! Hi, I'm Zhenchao. I have been working on a new feature of the Dogs app that shows how many people favorited a dog photo.",

    "video_description": "Explore how you can use the Sound Analysis framework in your app to detect and classify discrete sounds from any audio source — including live sounds from a microphone or from a video or audio file — and identify precisely in a moment where that sound occurs. Learn how the built-in sound classifier makes it easy for you to identify over 300 different types of sounds without the need for a custom trained model. This includes a variety of noises, ranging from human sounds, musical instruments, animals, and various items.\n\nFor custom models, see how you can leverage the Audio Feature Print feature extractor to create smaller models with variable sound window control to better serve your app's purposes.\n\nFor more about Sound Classification and the Sound Analysis framework, watch “Training Sound Classification Models in Create ML” from WWDC19.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi. Welcome to the Sound Analysis session at WWDC. My name is Jon Huang. I'm a researcher on the audio team. Today, my colleague, Kevin, and I will introduce enhancements to sound classification made available through the SoundAnalysis framework and CreateML. In 2019, we made it possible to train sound classification models using CreateML. We showed it was easy to create sound classification models and to deploy them in Apple devices. When you use this framework, all of the computations are optimized for hardware acceleration and are done locally on-device. This helps preserve your user's privacy because audio is never sent to the Cloud. We leveraged the Sound Analysis framework to introduce the Accessibility Feature called Sound Recognition. This feature can provide notifications to the user when certain sounds are heard in the environment like alarms, pets, and other household sounds. This is just one application of sound classification. Let's see what else we can do with it. The demo app is using my Mac's built-in microphone to listen to sounds in the environment. It's passing audio through a sound classifier and displaying the classification results in the UI. So as I'm chatting to you, speech is detected. Please sit back with me for a bit and see what happens. Make yourself comfortable. Let's start with some music. Hey Siri, play \"Catch a Vibe\" by Karun and Mombru.",

If you'd like to follow along, you can find the source code for this app in the session resources. Let's log in and get started. In our last session, we added a couple of tasks into the app. Since then, I've been getting all kinds of notifications from Jamie. I have a feeling that something's up. Let's see. Jamie will arrive at the clinic in 10 minutes. Jamie shared a Motivation Playlist. Wow! As you can see, the ever-enthusiastic Jamie is on his way to meet with the clinicians right now. It looks like Jamie has asked us to make a couple of changes and to add two new features. The first bit is about enhancing the surveys that we implemented in session two. Jamie says he got some feedback about them from testers. He told us the feedback that he got was that testers want to be able to tell what answers they gave after the fact. Right now, the card just shows that the survey has been completed, but if you scroll back in time a couple of days, there's no way to tell what answer you gave on that day. They'd also like us to restrict editing to the current date. You shouldn't really be able to delete survey answers or redo range of motion tests in the past. Similarly, it doesn't really make sense that you can scroll out into the future and preanswer surveys on days that haven't come yet. So we'll start off by addressing that feedback and enhancing the surveys a bit. We've also got this Insights tab that's still looking a bit lonely. Jamie asked that we display a pair of charts there. One will capture the relationship between sleep and pain, and the other will show improvement in range of motion over time. Finally, Jamie tells me that the doctors have asked we include some educational content to help participants understand what a torn meniscus is, and ResearchKit will be able to help us out there. We're going to begin by enhancing the surveys. Let's tackle showing the answers the patient gave. We'll go ahead and display the given answers as text in the card.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi. Welcome to Meet Safari Web Extensions on iOS. I'm David Quesada, an engineer on the Safari team. And today, I'll be walking through an exciting new feature in iOS 15, Safari Web Extensions. Web Extensions are a powerful type of browser extension that allows users to extend and customize their browsing in a huge number of ways. They're built with the standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And the WebExtension API has been available for all the major desktop browsers for a while, which means you can write a browser extension once and deploy it across all those browsers, reaching so many users. But now, I'm thrilled to tell you that Web Extensions are coming to iOS 15, letting you build a browser extension for more users than ever. I'd love to show you a demo now of a Safari Web Extension running on iOS. I'll be showing off an extension called Sea Creator. This extension was originally written for browsers on the Mac, but I've been working on bringing it to iOS. This extension shows me fun facts about sea creatures and makes reading more about sea life fun by replacing the names of sea creatures with emoji. Let's take a look at this on an iPad. Now, I've just installed Sea Creator, and I've opened up Safari, where I'm reading an article about fish. I'd really love to start using Sea Creator here so I can liven up this page with some emoji. So I'll open up the action menu and drill into the new Extensions list, which shows me all the extensions that I have available, including Sea Creator. So I'll turn it on. Now, another feature of Sea Creator is that I can put it front and center in Safari with a custom Start Page that I use every time I open a new tab. I'll check that out in a bit. And now that I've turned on Sea Creator, it's right there in the Action menu ready for me to use. And when I do that, Safari asks me if I'm OK with giving Sea Creator full access to this site. We brought the same Web Extensions permission model from Safari on the Mac to iOS, which means I, as the user, have full control over how much of my browsing extensions can access. I'll talk in more detail about this later. But right now, I'll allow Sea Creator to run. And just like that, it swapped in all these fish emoji on the page, which is just how I like to read it. It's also opened this popup showing me a running total of just how many words I've replaced so far. But it's not just this one page. I gave Sea Creator permission to work across this website as a whole. So as I navigate to other pages, Sea Creator is still working for me and gives me emoji here as well. I don't need to go out of my way to open the extension again once I've started using it. Of course, Sea Creator has one more feature that I mentioned earlier. When I open up a new tab to do some more browsing, I'm greeted by this bold New Tab page from Sea Creator with a fact of the day today about starfish-- and once again, that counter showing me just how many emoji Sea Creator has given me so far. This is pretty cool. So that was a quick look at Sea Creator working great on iOS. In this session, I want to show how you too can create a Safari Web Extension for iOS. And I'll be using Sea Creator as an example of how I took an existing extension and brought it to iOS with just a few changes. But don't worry if you've never written a browser extension before. I'll give you an overview of how Web Extensions work and how you can get started creating a new one. Along the way, I'll cover some debugging techniques and best practices to help your extension be the best it can be. And I'll wrap it up with some thoughts on user privacy and how it relates to the permissions model of Safari Web Extensions. So, our journey begins with creating a web extension that can run on iOS in the first place. Let's look behind the scenes to understand how this works. It's important to understand that for Safari, Web Extensions are parts of apps. So when you want to install a web extension, you install its app. And like any other type of iOS app, apps with Safari Web Extensions can be found on the App Store. And Xcode has everything you need to build an app to ship your extension. So when you think about building a Safari Web Extension for iOS, you may be starting from one of three places. Maybe you're looking at creating a new extension from scratch, or maybe you already wrote one for another browser, and you want to bring it to Safari, or perhaps you already have an extension for Safari on the Mac, and you want to make it available on iOS too. I want to go over what you can do in each of these cases. So first, if you want to create a brand-new Web Extension, you can use Xcode's included templates, which make it super easy to get started. You can create a new Xcode project and use the Safari Extension App template to start building a web extension as well as its containing app. And when you use this template, you get an extension that comes complete with all the resources a typical web extension might have. You can use this as a starting point by customizing what's already there or adding or removing pieces according to what your extension needs. Now, if you've already built a Web Extension for another browser, you can take advantage of a tool called the Safari Web Extension Converter to automatically create an Xcode project from that existing extension. You simply run the converter on the command line, provide it a path to your extension's resources, and it will create a new Xcode project that packages your extension in a native app. And new in Xcode 13, the Safari Web Extension Converter creates a project that supports Safari on both iOS and macOS by default. And the newly created project, by default, references your existing extension's resources at the original path rather than copying them. Finally, if you've already set up an Xcode project in the past to build a Safari Web Extension for macOS, you can also use the converter to upgrade that project so it supports iOS too. You can run the converter and provide a --rebuild-project option along with a path to your Xcode project. Then the converter will add an iOS-compatible version of the extension and a containing app to your project. Now I want to show the Safari Web Extension Converter in action by retracing my steps of bringing Sea Creator to iOS for the very first time.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, I’m Jen Simmons. And I’m here to talk about how the new Safari impacts web design and development. If you’re a web designer, a web developer, or have any role involved in making a website or a web app, this session is for you. This is a huge year for Safari. In this session, we’re going to focus on the visual or interaction design impact of the changes in Safari. Safari has an all-new design. By default, your website’s gonna look great, but if you wanna go the extra mile, this session will empower you to make your work really shine in the new Safari. We’ll talk about a few of the great new features in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS and how they’ll impact the web. We’ll cover what’s new in CSS, including my favorite, the new aspect-ratio property. And we’ll take a look at form controls, controls we’ve newly implemented and a whole new look for forms on iOS and iPadOS. Let’s start with the design of the browser itself. Since very early in the evolution of the web browser, most of the browsers we’ve used have had a few fundamental things in common. There’s a very tall toolbar at the top with a slot for the URL that’s on its own line. And the website stays inside this space, this portal to the web, the viewport. Of course, as users, we’ve trained ourselves to put all of our focus on the website that we’re using, but for years, the browser itself has maintained a strong visual presence. No, matter how a website is designed to look and feel, the browser interface framed that design and dominated it. What if we could get rid of that frame and extend the design of the website to every edge of the window? Well, that’s what we’ve done in Safari 15. This year, we’ve reimagined the browsing experience as we know it. We’re putting all the focus on the web content. The new Safari blends the tab bar into each website by changing its background color. The entire interface is on one line, and things naturally appear when needed. This makes your content feel more expansive. Each web page or web app takes over, extending to all four edges of the window. The browser interface yields to the content. So what determines which color is used for the background of the toolbar? As a web designer or developer, you can choose the color and code that choice into your HTML. For sites that don’t provide a color, Safari will figure out a color to use. Sometimes Safari matches the background color of the web page. Other times, it matches the header background. To provide your choice for the toolbar color, put it in the HTML head using a meta tag with name=“theme-color,” and use the content attribute to specify the color. By providing this information in the HTML head, Safari will get it immediately on page load. It’s also declarative code. It’s very simple to use. You can support both Light and Dark Mode by setting two colors. Yes, now you can add media attributes to meta tags. In this case, media=“(prefers-color-scheme: light)” in the first meta tag and “(prefers-color-scheme: dark)” in the second. This is a new addition to the HTML specification that we proposed this spring. It gives us a simple, robust way to hook into which color scheme the user has asked for. In browsers that do support name=“theme-color” but don’t yet support using the media attribute on meta tags, those browsers will use the first theme-color declaration and ignore the rest. So put your fallback first, not last, the way you do in CSS. Even if your site doesn’t have a whole design for Dark Mode, you might want to set your own color for the tab bar when the device is in Dark Mode. If the one color you’ve specified is too light, Safari will make adjustments in order to give the user the Dark Mode experience that they’ve asked for. Instead of defining the theme color on the HTML head, you can define it in a web manifest file. If you specify it in both places, the color in the HTML head is the one that’s used. And right now in June of 2021, there’s not yet a way to define multiple colors for Light and Dark Modes in a web manifest file. There’s discussion happening in the working group right now to figure that out. There’s also a very narrow range of colors that Safari isn’t going to apply - colors, really, that would totally get in the way of the user’s experience, maybe making it inaccessible. For these, Safari will do something else, like here, changing this site’s tab bar to white. If the color that you’ve chosen doesn’t seem to be working, just try adjusting it a bit. If you’d like, you can set the theme color to be different on different parts of your website. Each separate HTML page has its own head. Or you can use JavaScript to swap out the theme color dynamically in reaction to a user’s behavior. Think through ways that your design can blend the tab bar seamlessly into your site.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Jonathan Hogg: Hello, and welcome to this session on the Accelerate and associated frameworks. I'm Jonathan from Apple's Vector & Numerics team, and today I'm going to talk to you briefly about the Accelerate framework before telling you what's new in our machine learning library, BNNS. I'll then cover improvements to simd.h, and introduce Apple Archive, and our new Apple Encrypted Archive containers. So let's get started with a brief overview of the Accelerate framework. Accelerate provides high-performance numerical computation across all Apple platforms: MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS. Accelerate also provides access to the machine learning accelerators in Apple Silicon Macs and recent iPhone and iPad devices. The only way to leverage this hardware is by calling Accelerate either directly or through higher-level frameworks such as Core ML. Accelerate is composed of several parts. vDSP provides primitives for signal processing such as DFT and FFT routines. vImage provides routines for image processing such as format conversion and convolution. vForce provides vectorized versions of transcendental functions such as sine and cosine. BLAS and LAPACK provide high-performance implantations of the standard dense matrix algebra routines, while Sparse BLAS and our Sparse Solvers provide similar functionality for sparse matrices. Finally, BNNS provides support for machine learning. I'm also going to talk to you today about some related frameworks. simd.h provides computational small vectors and matrices, such as those covered in graphics programming, whilst Compression and Apple Archive provide support for lossless data compression. In order to use these frameworks, simply add the relevant include or import statement to your code and add the framework to your Xcode project. Now, let me tell you about BNNS in more detail. BNNS stands for Basic Neural Network Subroutines and provides performance primitives for machine learning on the CPU. For those of you unfamiliar with Apple's machine learning ecosystem, this diagram shows the lay of the land. There are three main hardware blocks: the CPU, which includes the machine learning accelerators I mentioned previously; the GPU; and the separate neural engine. BNNS provides performance primitives on the CPU in the same way as MPS provides performance primitives on the GPU. Above this layer, there are a number of frameworks that run on one or more of these backends. These include Apple's high-level machine learning frameworks -- Core ML and Create ML -- as well as the specialist frameworks like Vision and Natural Language. BNNS provides support for both training and inference across a wide range of layer types, as well as support for the optimizers shown at the bottom. In this release, we have added support for several new layer types: embedding, random fill, and quantization; as well as support for AdamW optimizer. We've also improved existing layers, adding two new activation functions: SiLU and HardSwish, as well as support for new arithmetic functions: ternary select, multiply add, as well as element-wise minimum and maximum. Layer fusions provide the ability to consume the output of one layer immediately as the input to a subsequent layer, avoiding the need to write it out to memory and read it back in again. We've added layer fusions of convolution and fully connected layers with the new quantization layer, as well as a fusion between the arithmetic and normalization layers. Other improvements include improved support for gradient clipping in the optimizer, which can also be used as standalone functions, as well as AMSGrad support for our Adam-based optimizers. Together, these improvements have expanded the range and network architectures we can accelerate even further. Now, let me tell you about some improvements to simd.h. simd.h provides computational primitives on small vectors and matrices that fit into the CPU's registers, including support for functions such as sine and cosine as well as useful geometric operations, including support for quaternions. The thing I really like about simd.h is it lets us jump in and get 90 percent of the benefit of vectorization with 10 percent of the effort. Here, let me show you. Here's a neural network activation function I just invented. As you can see, it has three different branches. If the input is less than minus pi, I just return zero. If it's between minus pi and pi, I return two times the exponent of x, multiplied by x plus pi over two. Otherwise, if it's greater than pi, I return two times the exponent. That's great, but if I have a large amount of data, I may want to run it faster than a scalar loop allows. So let me show you how to implement that in simd. I already have some boilerplate in place, an extension which allows me to easily write vectors to a buffer, and a simple loop that iterates over our output array in increments of one length eight vector at a time. The interesting part is how to translate our scalar function into a simd equivalent. Let's start by looking again at our scalar code. I see it has several branches. These don't work well for vectorization. Instead, let's construct this out of parts we can merge based on a mask. Looking more closely, if x is less than minus pi, I just return zero. If it's greater, I return an expression involving two times exponent of x. Let's pull that out.  Now, we want to construct a vector from that y, replacing with zero everywhere that x is element-wise less than minus pi. Next, we can look at a greater than case. Here, we are either multiplying by one in the high region, or by x plus pi over two in the middle region. So let's write that in the same way. We take our x plus pi over two expression  and this time we're replacing with one everywhere that x is element-wise greater than or equal to pi. Now all that remains is to multiply these two quantities together.  Obviously, if a zero element, multiplying by either value of b still returns zero. So let's run that and see how it looks.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Wil Addario-Turner: Hi, welcome to \"Embrace Expected Failures in XCTest.\" My name is Wil, and in this session, I'm going to discuss ways of improving the data you get when you run your project's tests. To begin with, let's consider why we test our code in the first place. Of course, at a high level, it's how we ensure the quality of the product. But in more concrete terms, I would say it's to discover bugs before we ship and not afterwards. Now, testing is an investment. It takes resources to create, run, and maintain tests. As with any investment, we want to maximize our returns while minimizing our cost. This session focuses on tools for reducing the maintenance cost. By maintenance, I'm primarily referring to how you handle failures when they occur in your test suites. When a test that's been passing begins to fail, that's a valuable piece of new information. This indicates either a flaw in the product, a problem in the test itself, or some issue in one of the dependencies -- that is, all of the frameworks and subsystems on top of which the product sits. Regardless of the type of problem, once that failure has been registered, subsequent reports of the same failure are significantly less valuable, because they represent information that you already have. Ideally, any new failure is triaged and fixed quickly. However, your team may not be able to resolve a problem right away, which means that the failure quickly goes from being a valuable piece of new information to a noisy distraction. Given a known failure in your tests that cannot be immediately resolved, what tools are available for managing the noise? Two approaches that might come to mind are disabling and skipping. Let's consider the tradeoffs for these and then we'll talk about the best tool -- and the topic of this session -- XCTest's ExpectedFailures API. Xcode lets you disable tests in the test plan or scheme. You can use this for known test failures, and one advantage is that your test code will continue to be compiled. However, since the code won't execute, you won't see it in the test report. This reduced visibility makes it harder to track as an issue that needs to be resolved. Where this feature -- the ability to choose which tests are enabled or disabled -- really shines is for curating collections of tests for specific purposes. But it's rarely the best way to handle a known failure. XCTSkip is another way you might manage a failing test. With this approach, not only does the code continue to get built with your tests, it also executes up until the point where XCTSkip is called. This means that it's included in the test report, giving you much better visibility of the issue. However, it doesn't execute all of your test, which means you lose out on potentially useful information in the form of new issues and changes to the existing issue. XCTSkip is a great tool for managing configuration-based limitations on your test, such as requiring a specific OS version or device type. In the example here, the test will be skipped if it's not running on an iPad. This brings us to XCTExpectFailure, a set of functions in XCTest specifically designed for managing known failures. In Swift, it has a number of overloads for different use cases, and Objective-C provides the same capabilities with several distinct functions. With this API, your test executes normally, but the results are changed as follows: Failure in the test will be reported as an expected failure. Failure in the test suite containing that test will be reported as a pass, unless of course some other test in it fails. This eliminates the noise generated by the failure, making it easier to see whether there are any other issues in your tests. Of course, suppressing the noise doesn't solve the underlying issue. So to help you keep track of it, the API takes a failure reason. This string documents the problem in your code and you can even embed a URL for your issue-tracking system. Xcode's test report UI shows expected failures just as it does normal failures or skipped tests. When you hover, if the failure reason contains a URL, an issue-tracking button appears that lets you jump out to the link. So let's see how this works! I have here a simple project with some unit tests for my VendorAccount class. I'm going to run the tests, and when they finish, we'll see that one is failing while the other is passing. You can see three test result icons, one for each test. A red X for the failing test and a green check for the passing test, and one for the test suite; a red X because one of the tests in the suite has failed, so we consider the suite itself to have failed. Now I'm going to add a call to XCTExpectFailure at the beginning of the failing test. You can see the failure reason begins with a URL that references the bug I've filed to keep track of this failure. Now I'll rerun the tests and we'll see how this affects the outcome. OK, so the red X icon for the failing test has changed to a gray X, which is the indicator for an expected failure. What's even more interesting is that the test suite icon has changed from a red X to a green dash. This icon indicates that the test suite has passed with a mixed state, meaning that one or more of its tests did not pass, but was either a skip or an expected failure. So that's how easy it is to use XCTExpectFailure to handle a failing test. Now let's take a closer look at the API.",

ResearchKit is an open source iOS framework that Apple maintains in collaboration with our GitHub community. It provides UI elements for gathering consent, administering surveys, and recording sensor data while participants perform activities, such as physical or cognitive exercises. CareKit, likewise, is also a fully open source framework, and it’s designed to help with building out patient-facing care apps. It excels at scheduling tasks that you want patients to perform, like taking medications or calling their doctor. It also provides a secure persistence layer for health-related data and has utilities for charting. Now, in past WWDC sessions, we’ve often discussed these two sibling frameworks in isolation, but this year we’re going to show you how they can be used together to create even better experiences for patients...

We're really excited to talk through the process of designing for Apple Watch Series 7, but before we get started, let's take a quick look at what's new. Apple Watch Series 7 comes in two new sizes: 41 mm and 45 mm. Both watches feature larger active content areas than ever before. The 41 mm is 176 by 215 points, and the 45 mm is 198 by 242 points. The display on Apple Watch Series 7 curves over the edge, featuring a subtle wraparound effect. The bezel around the screen is thinner and less visible than ever before. Additionally, the screen has a larger corner radius than previous devices. Keeping these key hardware differences in mind, we identified three useful design principles to shape the UI. Series 7 has the largest content areas we've had on watch. We enlarged UI components to make full use of the additional space for enhanced usability. We closely examined typography and color to create clearer hierarchy in watch apps. Apple Watch has always been about lightweight, glanceable experiences. We took a look at navigation and wayfinding to offer a better sense of place in just a quick glance. In summary, apps for Apple Watch Series 7 should be larger, clearer, and more glanceable. In the next section, Jenn will talk about how you can use updated UI elements to embody these principles in your own apps. Jennifer Patton: Thanks, Deena. Let's start with layout margins. Because the corners are so curved, content needs to come in and down so it fits well in the corners. Status bars get taller, matched by a taller scroll clearance margin at the bottom of the screens. And with the smaller bezel between the active display area and the hardware casing, we were discerning about content that nears the edges of the screen. Layout margins are generous on Series 7 to give the content plenty of room to breathe.",

This year, colors are the hot thing on our team. Most of the implementation is already done. Now I just need to finish it by adding some rich graphics. As we customize the app, we're going to see a few different areas: working with the safe area, including customizing it; new foreground style support; a rich new set of materials; and drawing with Canvas, a powerful new view. So let's get started. I'll show you what's in the app so far. We have a library of gradients, and I can view those gradients. There's something about this one I really like. I just can't put my finger on it. I can also edit a gradient... which lets me change the color stops.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Simon Goldrei: Hello. This session is all about how to transition media gaplessly with HLS. I'm Simon and I'm a member of the Streaming Media team here at Apple! Do you utilize AVQueuePlayer, or would like to offer your customers a seamless, Up Next-style playback of HLS items in your application? Do you want to present your media with the continuity that the producer intended? Can we support our customers by providing an experience to enjoy our media for longer? If yes, then you've tuned in to the best session to learn how you can now transition HLS items gaplessly. Here's our agenda. We'll survey some of the engaging media experiences you can deliver with this new feature, I'll detail the media authoring requirements, I'll step through some playlist examples highlighting best practices, and we'll end with a demo. The benefits of transitioning between HLS-backed AVPlayerItems in an AVQueuePlayer are straightforward. Until now, the point of transition could be a little jarring; anything from an audible glitch to a momentary visual hiccup or even an indication of indeterminate buffering. Gapless item transitions maintain a bond that your application provides between the customer and the content. Perhaps you recall the phrase \"don't touch that dial.\" You can build an episodic treatment that seamlessly transitions from the end of one episode into the start of another. Gapless transitions permit the ability to replicate the seamless track-to-track album experiences that we've long enjoyed. When doing this, we're delivering a more correct reproduction of what may have been live or intentionally authored. We can deliver an experience that is unbroken and uninterrupted. We can replicate linear programming. But we can also provide a dynamic and perhaps even interactive experience that takes the viewer from one task or scene and directly segues into the next. Consider a transition between a set of workouts or other instructional media. With gapless transitions we can now, programmatically, stitch scenes of an audiovisual sequence while maintaining accurate continuity. You can add reps... ...or add a cooldown, to the workout. We can achieve all of this while still delivering media with all the benefits of adaptive bitrate media streaming over HTTP. Of course, we use this, too! New features of Apple Music deliver content via HLS and achieve a gapless transition between each song. We're very excited to bring this to our customers, and we'd like to offer this to your customers, too. Let's now take detailed look at the authoring requirements you need to incorporate to affect the same item transitions in your HLS content. By providing -- in your HLS manifests -- variants that offer audio-format continuity between sequential items, you're enabling a gapless transition. Your content should provide variants that match the following audio media traits: the use of FairPlay Streaming, the audio codec -- specified by the codecs attribute of the Stream tag -- and the channel count, as specified by the Channels attribute of the Media tag. Note that if you decide to offer audio renditions, at different sample rates and bit depth, you may inhibit the gapless transition. The same advice to provide a match and maintain continuity applies to these traits, too. Which is to say, to achieve a gapless transition, be sure to offer equivalent audio media in each variant for consecutively enqueued items. Finally, when authoring your media, please adhere to CMAF authoring guidance. CMAF stands for \"common media application format.\" In this MPEG specification, there is a specific recommendation to use an edit list to signal the presence of priming and remainder frames. Let's now look at a simple example by inspecting the master variant playlists of two candidate items. In this HLS manifest I've offered four audiovisual variants: a pair of 720p variants and a pair of 1080p variants. Within each pair, I offer a variant encoded with the High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Codec, HE_AAC, and another with AAC Low Complexity, or AAC_LC. In this example, consider that playback conditions support the selection of the 720p video paired with HE_AAC. As playback nears the end, the AVQueuePlayer will, at least initially, select the similarly encoded variant offered in the subsequent item. This is true even if network conditions now support a higher-quality tier. Servicing the gapless transition is a higher priority than choosing a high quality when transitioning gaplessly. As playback proceeds, the adaptive bitrate heuristics are evaluated and, if the conditions persist, the player will seamlessly switch to that higher quality. Fantastic! Now suppose we didn't offer HE_AAC in item two. In that case, the AVQueuePlayer is unable to maintain audio continuity and the gapless transition but is free to select the most appropriate initial variant for the playback conditions. Let's say that we have authored our content to support a gapless transition. In that case, we should remind ourselves how to use an AVQueuePlayer. Here we have a short code snippet. We create two AVPlayerItems and enqueue them, in order, ahead of playback. Note that our items source from two different URLs. After creating our AVQueuePlayer, we can use the \"insert after\" method to inform the queue player of the intended sequence. All that's left is to message \"play\".",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Jer Noble: Hello, I'm Jer! And I work on media playback in WebKit and Safari here at Apple. People love watching their favorite shows and movies and listening to their music together, whether it’s with people in the same room, next door, or on the other side of the world. And now with GroupActivities, it’s easier than ever to provide a SharePlay experience to your users, wherever they are. In this session, we'll cover four topics. An introduction to coordinated playback in Safari; how to prepare your iOS app to work with SharePlay in Safari; how to adopt the Media Session API in your app's web page; and a new web API for coordinating playback across multiple devices. So let’s start by talking a little bit about SharePlay and Safari. In the previous session, you learned how to create an amazing SharePlay experience in your iPhone and iPad applications with GroupActivities. And on macOS Monterey, you can bring that same experience -- along with your great iPhone and iPad apps -- to Mac using Catalyst. And if your application has a companion website, you can bring that same amazing SharePlay experience to your Mac Safari 15 users, without requiring those users to download your app from the App Store. And that’s what I’m going to show you how to do in this session. I’ve been working on an iPhone application that lets you watch movie trailers. I’ve already added support for GroupActivities to my app, and that lets friends watch movie trailers together over FaceTime. But my movie trailers app also has a website. And here’s how it should look once I add support for GroupActivities in that web page as well. I’m on a FaceTime call with my friend Sam. Sam loves watching movie trailers, so I’ve asked them to help me test this new Movie Trailers app. When they start playing a new trailer in that app during our call, I’ll be invited to watch that trailer through a notification. It will give me the option to join the session in Safari. When I click that notification, Safari will be launched with a URL for the shared content, and when Sam starts playing the trailer, it will play here in Safari at the same time. I can pause, play, and even seek the video here in Safari, and everyone else in the session will see those same commands reflected in their local video at the same time. It's going to be really great! So, what will it take to add GroupActivities support to the movie trailers website? Before we take a look under the hood of Safari -- at the new Web APIs available in Safari 15 -- let's talk about how to get your app ready to work with Safari through GroupActivities. In order to join a GroupActivities session with Safari, a user with your iPhone or iPad app will need to create a GroupSessionActivity with a fallbackURL that points to your website. The fallbackURL must identify not just your website, but the specific content to be played. When a Watch Together invitation is issued by an iPhone user to a user on a Mac, Safari will be launched and asked to load the URL that you provide in GroupSessionActivity. Once the fallbackURL is loaded in Safari, your site will need to implement a few simple but important Web APIs. The first is Media Session. Media Session is a standard Web API which allows your site to tell the browser -- Safari -- more about the current state of media playback within your page. Your site can tell the browser the current play state, the duration of your content. It can provide artwork for the current playback item. It can even tell the browser that the current content is an advertisement that can be skipped. Once the Browser has all this metadata available, it can provide that metadata to the rest of the operating system and present it to your users outside of the browser window itself. One place the operating system displays that data is within something called \"Now Playing.\" Now Playing is a great way for users to quickly see and control the media that they’re enjoying right now. In iOS, users can access Now Playing from the Control Center as well as from the Lock screen. And now in macOS Monterey, users can access Now Playing directly from the menu bar. And Safari will use the information provided through Media Session to populate Now Playing with your content’s title, duration, play state, artwork, and more. Now Playing also allows users to control playback of what they’re listening to, by showing the user a simple set of playback controls. Your site can register with the Media Session for specific actions to perform when a user interacts with Now Playing, so that for example, when a user taps the Play button in Now Playing, Safari can run your site’s own action handler to begin playback. Media Session gives your site complete control over what metadata to expose to the browser, as well as control over how to implement playback commands. Need to do some set up or preflighting before beginning playback? No problem. With mediaSession’s play action handler, now you can. If your site has previously adopted Media Session, you’re halfway done already. But the movie trailers site hasn’t adopted Media Session yet, so let’s add support for that now. This site will want to add actions for play, pause, and seekto. To do so, we’ll use the mediaSession property of navigator. Let’s first add an action handler for play. We’ll call mediaSession. setActionHandler(), passing in the string play and an inline function that just calls play() on our video element. Then, we’ll do the same for pause and seekto. And to make sure that we’re accurately representing playback state to the browser, we’ll add event listeners to our video element and update mediaSession when that state changes. First, let’s add a function called updateMediaSessionState(). It will query the video element to find out if it’s playing or paused. Then it will set mediaSession’s playbackState property to either the string playing or paused, depending on the video element’s playback state. Next, it will query the video element’s duration, playback rate, and current time. Then, using those values, it will call mediaSession’s setPositionState() function, passing in those values in the dictionary parameter. Then, let’s add an event listener to detect when those values change, and call updateMediaSessionState() to update mediaSession with those new values. We’ll need an event listener for playing, pause, duration change, rate change, and time change. And last, because the movie trailers website has both a title string and a URL for the title artwork, we can set the Media Session’s metadata property to a new MediaMetadata object containing those values. So let’s try it out! I’ll reload my page in Safari, begin playing, then click on the Now Playing icon in the system menu. And I see the title and artwork in the Now Playing panel. And when I tap the Pause button, our pause action handler is called and playback pauses. Media Session provides the building blocks for a Watch Together experience in a web page, by providing a mechanism for the browser to tell the page it should start or stop playback. Now we’re ready move onto the second part of creating a cowatching experience in our web page: coordinating playback across every device in the session. To do so, we’ve extended Media Session by adding a new property on it called \"Coordinator.\" Your page will use Media Session's Coordinator to inform every other user in the session of the page’s intent to begin or pause playback, to seek to a specific point in the media’s timeline, or to move to the next item in a playlist. The Coordinator will communicate those intents with all the other devices in the session and listen for changes to every other device's play state, resolve conflicts, and wait for everyone to be ready to begin playback. And when everyone is ready, the Coordinator will use the Media Session action handlers we added earlier to start playback along all the other users in the session. And if another user pauses playback for whatever reason, the Coordinator will call your Media Session’s pause action handler. That said, I’d like to point out a few caveats. The Coordinator interface is an experimental web API; it has yet to go through standardization, and while that process will likely improve this API, some aspects of the API may change. To find out more, please watch the W3C’s Media Session GitHub page. This API is currently only implemented in Safari, though the GroupActivities framework, which Safari uses to implement the Coordinator, can -- and we hope will -- be adopted by other Mac browsers. And the final caveat is that while your users can join an existing session in Safari, a GroupSession currently must be initiated from an iPhone, iPad, or macOS application. So let’s add support for the Coordinator now. The first thing I’d like to do is join the session once it becomes available. So I’m going to add a coordinatorchange event listener to mediaSession. In the handler, if there’s a non-null coordinator property on mediaSession, I’ll call its join() function. I’d also like to add an icon to my controls to show that we’re playing back in a session. So in the handler, I’ll either show or hide the icon, based on whether there’s a coordinator property on mediaSession. I’m also going to hook up a click event listener to the icon to call leave() on the coordinator. Next, I’m going to modify the event handlers for my custom controls to check for the presence of a coordinator, and if we have one, call the appropriate coordinator function instead. I’ll add one for my Play button, and then for my Pause button, and also for timeline slider. And let’s see it in action! I’ve got an invite here from my friend Sam, and I’m going to accept it. My page loads to the same content that Sam is watching on their iPhone. And when I click the Play button, both Sam's iPhone and my web page begin playing simultaneously. Allie Fox: The way we get there is an adventure. Dina: I'm scared. Allie: If it didn't feel that way, it wouldn't be an adventure. ♪ < That was great. Now that the trailer's ended, Sam uses the iPhone to scrub back to the beginning.",

    "video_transcript": "Hello, and welcome to WWDC. My name is Manjeet Chawla, a technical program manager at the App Store, and I'm really excited to talk about some new features that will help you support customers and handle refunds. This is the third session of a three-part series focusing on in-app purchases. And if you haven't already watched \"Meet StoreKit 2\" or \"Manage in-app purchases on your server,\" I recommend you take a look after this session so you get the full story. In this session, I'll first talk about customer support and how you can provide contextual support to your customers. And because refunds are a critical part of support, my colleague, Joe, will talk about handling refunds and a new server API to inform and improve the refund process. Let's start with supporting customers, the benefits and the challenges of providing scalable support as your business grows on the App Store. Whether your app offers auto-renewing subscriptions or one-time in-app purchases like consumables or non-consumables, we are introducing new StoreKit and App Store server APIs for you to help resolve customer support issues in a timely and efficient manner. And in addition to providing support, these APIs will help you manage your relationships with existing customers after you initially acquire them, increase your overall retention, improve customer satisfaction, which can lead to higher engagement, and reduce churn that grows your long-term revenue. Today, if customers need help for their in-app purchase, they may either contact Apple or you, the developer. And based on the scenario, customers can either use Apple's self-service website, \"Report-A-Problem,\" or contact Apple Support via phone, email, or chat to address the issue. Alternatively, they may also contact you via social media, forums, or live-chat inside the app. And when they contact you about an in-app purchase, the issue may fall into one of these scenarios. From identifying customer's in-app purchases or refunds, to providing compensation for a service issue or an outage, or helping them manage their subscription or request a refund, these questions cover most of the support scenarios, and I'll walk through each scenario in more detail. Let's start with the first scenario, how do you identify the purchases made by a customer when they first contact you for support? Now, if you've purchased any content on the App Store, you may already have seen this email. Today, when customers make an in-app purchase, they receive an invoice for that purchase via email. This invoice contains an order ID, which is unique for each invoice. And customers have access to this via email or by looking at the purchase history under account settings. And now, when a customer contacts you for support, you can ask the customer for the order ID on their invoice and use a new server-to-server API to lookup in-app purchases for the invoice presented by the customer. In addition to validating the invoice, this API also helps you identify any issues with the in-app purchase. For example, if the invoice contains any purchases that have already been refunded by the App Store. Now, let's take a look at how this API works. So now, when a customer contacts your support team, you can ask the customer for the invoice order ID, and your server can call the invoice lookup API, and, in response, the App Store returns a status and the transactions for that invoice signed in a JWS format. And finally, using this information, you can provide support for the correct in-app purchases. To implement this API on your server, you can call the lookup endpoint with the invoice order ID in the URL and the Apple ID for the app in the request. The response includes a signedTransactions object, which contains the transactions for that invoice signed in a JWS format. You can decode the payload for each transaction to get the details of the purchase. Now, let's take a closer look at the new status field. This field identifies the overall status of the invoice. The possible values are 0, meaning the invoice is valid and contains transactions for this order ID, 1, meaning the order ID is invalid, and 2, meaning the invoice is valid, but no matching transactions were found for this order ID. Now, let's review an example of how you can use the response from this API. Here's a sample customer account database where you might be storing the originalTransactionId for each customer's in-app purchase, along with the productID and the purchase date. Using this API, you can link the invoice order ID with the customer's in-app purchases when they contact you about an issue. For example, if this customer purchased coins in your app, and if they contact you for support, you can store the invoice order ID for the purchased coins. Now, let's take a scenario where you have the originalTransactionId for a customer, and you want to lookup their past refunds. Today, you might be relying on verifyReceipt API or App Store server notifications to get notified about refunds. However, if there was an outage, and your server did not receive any notifications from the App Store, how do you lookup this customer's past refunds? We are introducing a new server-to-server API to lookup refunded transactions for a customer using the original transaction ID for any of their in-app purchases within your app. This API enables you to handle an outage or scheduled maintenance by looking up refunds at any time in a quick and easy manner. Additionally, this API can also help you identify the customer's entire refund history for your app. For example, if your app offers both subscriptions and consumables, this API returns all the refunded transactions across all your content types. To implement this API on your server, you create the request with original transaction ID in the URL and the Apple ID for the app in the request parameters. The response contains a list of refunded transactions signed in a JWS format. You can get the all the information needed about the purchases by decoding the payload for each transaction. So, going back to the sample customer account database, you can now use the information returned by this API to update the refunded transactions for this customer using the original transaction ID.",

    "video_transcript": "Hello and welcome to WWDC. Hey everyone. I'm David a machine learning engineer from the Create ML Team. And in this session we're going to talk about building Style Transfer models and Create ML. Style Transfer is a new machine learning task available this year in the Create ML app. It can be used to blend a style and content image together. Let's see what happens when we apply Style Transfer to this pair of images. Wow that's pretty cool! The stylized result looks great. The model has transferred the colors shapes and textures from the style image to the content image. The color of the style image is very important. The white background and black paint strokes from this style are transferred by the model to create a black and white result. Paintings aren't the only source of style. The model can learn and transfer the tiles from this mosaic as well. Express your creativity by using different patterns from nature. For example the ice cracks in this style can be transferred by the model to produce a pretty compelling result. These are just a few examples of what you can do with Style Transfer and Create ML. But wouldn't it be great if we could do even better. What if you could apply Style Transfer to more than just a static image. Amazing. Each frame is stylized fast enough to maintain a smooth stylization experience. You can use a Style Transfer model in real time for your video apps. Using the A13 bionic chip we can achieve a processing speed up to 120 frames per second. To train a Style Transfer model we need to provide some training data, a style image, and a directory of content images. The model learns the balance between content and style from your images. For optimal results the content images used for training should be similar to what you expect to stylize at inference time. In this example I have a directory of natural content images. You can use model parameters to optimize the behavior of a Style Transfer model. You can configure your model behavior with style strength and style density model parameters. Let's explore style strength first. With a style strength parameter. You can tune the balance between style and content. With low style strength, only parts of the background adopt the style image qualities and the people dancing have adopted only a small amount of blue color. Now with high style strength the background is even more stylized and the people dancing completely adopt the style image colors and ice cracks. Notice the difference when I put them next to each other. Next let's explore style density. With the style density parameter, course details can be learned by the model. Here, I've drawn a grid on top of the style image. Let's zoom in on a region. The model focuses on high level details in this region such as the bird and learns these coarse qualities. Here's an example of coarse stylization.",

    "video_transcript": "Hello and welcome to WWDC. My name is Shachi Khare, and I’m an engineer on the MusicKit team. Apple Music API is a web service that provides APIs for building Apple Music experience across platforms. In this video, I’m going to talk about some enhancements to the Apple Music API that'll enable you to cross reference Apple Music content. We will start with discussing cross storefront equivalency, followed by explicit and clean mapping. Then we will go over how you can cross reference library and catalog content. And finally, we’ll talk about looking up content using the UPC identifier. So let’s get started with cross storefront equivalency. Apple Music is a worldwide service that operates in many regions. Content varies from one geographical location to another. So each request to the API is accompanied by a storefront object which defines the desired region. Alternate versions of content may be available with different IDs between storefronts. For example, this album Chromatica has a content ID as shown here in the United States storefront, but an equivalent version of this album in the Japan storefront has a different ID. So if you fetch this album with the ID shown here in the U.S. storefront, you will get a successful response from the API. But if you use the same ID to fetch the album in the Japan storefront, you will get a 404 response. As a result, sharing the link to a piece of content with someone in a different storefront may not work. In order to solve this problem, we need to get the equivalent content ID in the target storefront. So in this example, given the content ID for this album Chromatica in the U.S. storefront, we need to find the content ID which represents this album in the Japan storefront. Here is the API that returns the equivalent in the target storefront. It takes the target storefront in the path and a filter query parameter that takes the content ID in the current storefront. This API supports fetching equivalents for albums, songs, and music videos. Here is an example of this API that takes the input album ID in the U.S. storefront, and we want to find the equivalent album ID in the Japan storefront. We have taken U.S. as an example of the input storefront and Japan as the target storefront, but you can choose any storefront supported by Apple Music. The response contains the equivalent version of the album in the Japan storefront. As you can see, the ID returned in the response is different from the one in the input to the API. Next let’s look at explicit and clean mapping.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Sergey Kamensky: Hello, everybody and welcome to WWDC. My name is Sergey Kamensky and I'm a software engineer in Vision framework team. The topic of today's session is to show how Vision framework can help with people analysis. Our agenda today consists of two main items. First we're going to have an overview of people analysis technology in Vision framework. While doing that, we will be specifically focusing on the new additions. And second, we're going to have the in-depth review of the new person segmentation feature. Let's start with people analysis technology first. The cornerstone of people analysis in Vision is person face analysis. Since the inception of Vision framework, we've been adding and enhancing human face analysis capabilities. We currently offer face detection, face landmarks detection, and face capture quality detection. Face detection functionality in Vision framework is exposed by the means of DetectFaceRectanglesRequest. Our face detector offers high precision and recall metrics, it can find faces with arbitrary orientation, different sizes, and also partially occluded. So far we have supported occlusions like glasses and hats. Now we are upgrading our face detector to revision number three which, in addition to improving all existing great qualities, can now also detect faces covered by masks. The main function of our face detector is of course to find face bounding box, but it can also detect face pose metrics. Previously, we have provided roll and yaw metrics only. Most metrics are reported in radians and their values are returned in discrete bins. With the new revision introduction, we're also adding a pitch metric and thus completing the full picture. But we didn't stop there. We're also making all three metrics reported in continuous space. All face pose metrics are returned as property of our FaceObservation object, which is the result of executing the DetectFaceRectanglesRequest. Let's look at the demo app that is designed to show face pose detection functionality. The app processes camera feed by running Vision face detector and presents face pose metrics to the user after converting the results from radians to degrees. For better tracking of the metric changes, the app uses red color gradient to show when face pose metrics increase in positive direction and blue color gradient to show when the metrics increase in negative direction. In both cases, the lighter the color is, the closer the metric is to the zero position. The zero position for each metric is what you would call a neutral position of a human head, when the person is looking straight -- just like this. As we already discussed, we have three face pose metrics: roll, yaw, and pitch. These terms come from flight dynamics and they describe aircraft principle axes with respect to the aircraft's center of gravity. The same terms have been adopted to describe human head pose as well. When applied to head pose -- or as we also call it, face pose -- they track human head movement as following. Roll is tracking head movement in this direction. When I'm going from the most negative to the most positive values of roll, you can see that the background color changes from dark blue to light blue, neutral, then light red, and finally dark red. Similar color changes are happening with the yaw metric, which is tracking the angle when the head is turning right or left. And finally, the pitch metric is tracking my head movement when my head is nodding up or down. Here you can see again similar color changes when I'm going from the most negative to the most positive end of the spectrum. Face landmarks detection is another important function of our face analysis suite. Face landmarks detection is offered by means of DetectFaceLandmarksRequest, and the latest revision is revision number three. This revision offers 76-point constellation to better represent major face regions and also provide accurate pupil detection. Face analysis suite also includes face capture quality detection. This holistic measure takes into account attributes like human face expressions, lighting, occlusions, blur, focusing, et cetera. It is exposed via DetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest API and the latest revision of this request is revision number two. It is important to remember that face capture quality is a comparative measure of the same subject. This feature works great, for example, to pick the best photo out of the photo burst series or to pick the best photo to represent a person in the photo library. This feature is not designed to compare faces of different people. Human body analysis is another big section of the people analysis technology offered by Vision framework. Vision provides several functions in this area, which include human body detection, human pose detection, and last but not least, human hand pose detection. First let's take a look at the human body detection. This function is offered via DetectHumanRectanglesRequest, and it currently detects human upper body only. We are adding new functionality to this request, and therefore upgrading this revision to revision number two. With the new revision, in addition to the upper-body detection, we also offer a full-body detection. The choice between the upper-body and the full-body detection is controlled via the new upperBodyOnly property of the DetectHumanRectanglesRequest. The default value for this property is set to true to maintain backwards compatibility. Human body pose detection is offered in Vision framework via DetectHumanBodyPoseRequest. Processing this request provides a collection of human body joint locations. Revision number one is the latest and the only available revision of this request. Vision framework also offers human hand pose detection as DetectHumanHandPoseRequest. Similar to human body pose detection, processing of the hand pose request returns a collection of human hand joint locations. We're upgrading functionality of this request by adding an important property to the resulting observation, hand chirality. The new chirality property of the HumanHandPoseObservation will contain information whether the detected hand was left or right. If you want to learn more details about hand pose detection, I recommend watching the \"Classify hand poses and actions with Create ML\" session. This concludes our overview of the new upgrades to the people analysis technology suite. It is time now to move to the second topic of our session, which is person segmentation. What is person segmentation? In very simple terms, it's the ability to separate people from the scene. There are numerous applications of the person segmentation technology nowadays. You are all familiar, for example, with virtual background feature on video conferencing apps. It's also used in live sport analysis, autonomous driving, and many more places. Person segmentation also powers our famous Portrait mode. Person segmentation in Vision framework is a feature designed to work with a single frame. You can use it in streaming pipeline, and it's also suitable for the offline processing. This feature is supported on multiple platforms like macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS. Vision framework implements semantic person segmentation, which means that it will return a single mask for all people in the frame.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Megan Gardner: Hello! My name is Megan Gardner, an engineer on the WebKit team, and today we're going to explore WKWebView additions together. Before we start our journey, let's make sure we know what we're exploring. Let me tell you what WKWebView is and why you might want to use it in your app. When a user clicks a URL, they are expecting a web page to load and be able to interact with that content. Loading the URL, rendering the content, and running any JavaScript on that content is a very complicated task! So we have encapsulated most of that work for you inside of WKWebView. And not just for you! WKWebView is the view that is used to show all web content on iOS and much of MacOS. This includes Safari. So if you need to show a web page in your app, then you might assume you need to add a WKWebView. But wait! What are you doing with that content? If you need a way to view a web page, but you don't need much customized interaction with that content, you probably just need an SFSafariViewController. This is like a tiny Safari inside your app. Using one of these views is incredibly simple, but there is a trade-off. There is little you can do to interact with the web content. But this year, we have made it easier to do just a bit more with Safari view controller. Your users have always been able to run app extensions through the share sheet on your Safari view controller's content, but for special functions built only for your app, that has been a little cumbersome and hard for users to discover. So in iOS 15, we have added a new API to bring one of your app extensions to a customized button on Safari view controller. You can map this button to one of your app's share extensions, and you can even set an image for that button that will best represent the extension that will run, allowing users to run your app extensions directly from the toolbar, including running JavaScript on the page. But this is still a very limited amount of interaction. And that's where WKWebView comes in. WKWebView allows you to do many things with the content that it is showing. We have many APIs for loading, manipulating, and interacting with the content. So, if you need to show web content, and you need to have complex interactions with it, then WKWebView is for you. And since WKWebView is about interacting with web content, we are always striving to make that easier for you to do. We take on more of the workload by making easy APIs for you to adopt that will help you access and manipulate the content of your web view. This year we have been hard at work, adding new and helpful features to WKWebView, and today, I'd love to tell you about some of them. First, we'll cover several APIs that will allow you to interact with and manipulate your web content without using having to inject JavaScript. Then we will cover several APIs that will give you access to functionality that previously has only been available in Safari, allowing for a deeper browser-like experience in your app. Before we go over these APIs that will allow you to opt-out of using JavaScript, let's review why you might want to avoid JavaScript. We love JavaScript! It is the language of the web! But injecting JavaScript is complicated. The interface between native and web that you need to cross via injection can be difficult and cumbersome to navigate. It can also easily have unintended side effects or be difficult to manage when dealing with content from multiple web sources. It's best to avoid that headache if you can. There are also some features that are just incompatible with injected JavaScript. Last year, we introduced a new feature called app-bound domains. This allows you to specify which domains you would like to allow deep interaction with in your app. App-bound domains helps increase the security and privacy of your app for your users. But to get this benefit, you cannot inject JavaScript into your web view. Doing so disables the feature. There are also other high-value features, like Apple Pay, that you do not have access to in your web view if you choose to inject JavaScript. Therefore, we've added several new APIs to allow you to easily interact with the content in your web view without having to deal with injecting JavaScript. These new APIs fall into three categories. First, we have simple ways for you to access the pages' theme color and related colors for a website. Next, a way to disable text interaction, as well as being able to control media playback in your web view. First, let's explore theme color. You might remember last year we told you about one of our mission-critical internal apps, Browser Pets, which was written by Brady Eidson to combine the feeds from our WebKittens and Pups on Safari websites. Well, with all the new APIs available, Brady and I decided we should update this important tool, to get the most out of our many morale-raising cats and dogs. One of the engineers on the WebKittens website has decided to add a dynamic theme color that changes with the season, adding a little flair to our important pet photos. I wanted this to be reflected in the app as well, but I did not want to duplicate the code. Fortunately, we have a new API that makes this very easy. As you can see here, I can set the color of the header view to the theme color of the website using this new API, thus leveraging the work that my fellow engineer put into the WebKittens website. The website engineer can even add new themes in the future, and they will be reflected in the app without any additional work on my part. If themeColor isn't set, in a future seed we have an alternate calculated background color exposed as underPageBackgroundColor, which you can use similarly. You might have noticed how Safari is using this to create a look that blends the app with the web page. You can even write to this value to customize the color that is used to fill the background when scrolling past the end of web content. Next, let's talk about text interaction. We have recently added videos to the WebKittens and Pups on Safari websites, and Browser Pets users have been complaining about accidentally activating the text selection controls when trying to play those videos. Well, we don't want that! Fortunately, there is a new API to quickly and easily disable text interaction on a web view. It's simple! When setting up your web view, just make sure to set textInteractionEnabled to false in the preferences used to create the web view. This will turn off all text interactions in that web view. Now text selection controls won't get in the way of the media controls, and we can play those kitty videos unhindered. Speaking of media controls, we have some great updates for media playback controls! Previously, if you wanted to pause or suspend media that was playing in your web view, you'd need to inject JavaScript. You'd also need to find the specific element in the DOM to be able to control it. But now, we have a simple API that makes it easy to control the state of media in your web view. You can now easily pause all media, close all media windows, get the state of the media on the page, or set media suspended, which will pause media and disable user controls until setAllMediaPlaybackSuspended is set to false. To help you get more familiar with these new APIs and how easy they are use, I'm going to turn it over to Brady who will show you how we utilized these new media control APIs in Browser Pets! Brady Eidson: Thanks, Megan. Hello, I'm Brady Eidson, an engineer on the WebKit team. As Megan alluded, both the WebKittens and Pups on Safari websites recently added the ability to post videos instead of just still images, which means our Browser Pets app has videos now, too. Here's how the app looks right now. These buttons are native UI buttons for various features I'm adding. That banner at the top of the page is web content, and the website has set a theme color, which I have adopted using the web view themeColor property Megan mentioned. Once videos were added, some folks expressed their preferences to not have videos autoplaying. This Pause button is to accommodate them. Let's see what it does.",

    "video_transcript": "Hi. I'm Saharsh Oza. I'm with the GPU Software Engineering team at Apple. Today my colleague, Yuliya Pylypiv, and I will talk about what's new in Metal Performance Shaders Graph. Let us begin. MPS is a library of metal-based, high-performance, GPU-accelerated primitives for varied fields like image processing, linear algebra, ray tracing, and machine learning. MPS team optimizes Metal kernels to give the best performance on each hardware across Apple's various platforms. Last year, we introduced the MPSGraph framework, a general purpose compute graph for the GPU. It is supported on macOS, iOS, iPadOS and tvOS, same as the MPS framework. Please watch our last year's session to get more introductory details on the MPSGraph. Let's take a look at the agenda. We have a lot to cover. We will discuss ML inference and training acceleration through MPSGraph. We will introduce some exciting new MPSGraph operations. We will introduce new ways for you to control compilation in MPSGraph. And finally, we will look at the all new control-flow capabilities of MPSGraph. I'd like to introduce my colleague, Yuliya, who will share some exciting updates for inference and training acceleration. Thanks, Saharsh. Hi. I'm Yuliya Pylypiv. I am a part of GPU Software team at Apple. Today, I want to share the improvements we've made to boost training and inference performance on GPU. Let's get right into it. The MPSGraph framework has been adopted by higher level machine learning frameworks like Core ML and TensorFlow for GPU acceleration. This year, we have optimized MPSGraph even further with a combination of kernel improvements and stitching adoption. This has translated to large performance gains to the machine learning frameworks that use MPS. Let's take a closer look at the new Metal Plugin for TensorFlow. TensorFlow is a popular machine learning training platform, and GPUs are the predominant accelerator device. This year, we have developed a new Metal Plugin using TensorFlow PluggableDevice Interface released in TensorFlow 2.5. This brings the power of Metal to TensorFlow using MPS and MPSGraph. This allows us to train any machine learning model on Mac platform GPUs without modifications. Now, let's see one of these in action. For this demo, I am going to use a Jupyter environment. On my M1 system, I have the latest available TensorFlow installed. When we list physical devices, you can see there is only a CPU device registered.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Becca Royal-Gordon: Hi, I’m Becca from the Swift Compiler team. I’m going to be talking today about how you can implement DSLs in Swift. If you’ve never heard that term, a DSL is a domain-specific language, and even if the name is new to you, you’ve probably used one before. I’m going to start by explaining what DSLs actually are and what they look like in Swift. Then I’ll explain how result builders work. They’re one of the main features used to implement Swift DSLs. After that, I’ll walk you through designing a simple DSL for part of our sample app, Fruta. And finally, I’ll show you how to write the implementation that’s in the Fruta sample code. But let’s start by explaining that acronym a little better. A DSL is a sort of miniature programming language that’s designed for programs that work in a specific area called a \"domain.\" Because the language is designed with a particular kind of work in mind, it can have special features which make that kind of work easier to do. So when you write code for a DSL instead of a general-purpose language, you only have to write the things that are specific to your exact problem. Many DSLs are declarative. That is, you’re not really writing precise instructions to solve the problem; it’s more like you’re describing the problem in the language, and then it goes and solves it for you. The traditional way you would do this is called a \"standalone DSL.\" You would design the entire language from scratch and write an interpreter or compiler for it. Embedded DSLs are a more modern alternative. In an embedded DSL, you use the built-in features of a host language like Swift to add the DSL’s implicit behavior to some parts of your code, effectively modifying the host language into one tailored for your domain. This is obviously way easier than designing the entire language and writing a compiler for it because you’re starting from an existing language that has already decided the basics of the syntax and already has a compiler. It also makes it easier to mix the DSL code together with non-DSL code. Often you want to use a DSL to solve a problem that’s just one part of a much larger app. If you’re writing a standalone DSL, you have to design a way to call from one language to the other. With an embedded DSL, the parts written in the DSL look like normal code to the rest of the app, so you have a much easier time interoperating. An embedded DSL can also use the tools designed for the host language. You already have debuggers and editors for Swift, and those work just fine for a Swift DSL; if you wanted those for a standalone DSL, you’d have to write your own. And because you’re starting from the host language, clients who already know that language have a lot less to learn. They already know how to declare a variable or whether there’s a space in \"else if\"; all they need to learn is how you’ve customized the language. Swift is designed to support embedded DSLs. And in fact, if you’ve used SwiftUI, you’ve already used one. The SwiftUI view DSL assumes you want to describe the layout of views on a device’s screen. So when you’re writing in the SwiftUI DSL, your custom code simply creates the views, and the DSL is responsible for building a tree out of them for SwiftUI to process. To understand the value of a DSL, think about what SwiftUI might be like if you wrote views in ordinary Swift instead. You’d have to create views, modify them, add them to other views, and return one at the end. You’d be creating temporary variables all over the place to hold individual views, and the result wouldn’t really convey the way the views are nested in the same way the DSL does. You’d write more code but it would convey less meaning. The SwiftUI DSL, by contrast, makes all of those tedious details implicit. It’s your job to describe the views; it’s the DSL’s job to collect the views you’re describing and figure out how to show them. But DSLs take extra effort to implement, and they take extra effort to use. So when do you want to create one? Well, there are no hard-and-fast rules, but here are some signs that you might want to use one. Look for places where the mechanics of using vanilla Swift obscure the meaning of the code. Where you spend half your time rearranging commas and square brackets and parentheses every time you change something, or have to append things to temporary arrays to accommodate the control flow. Look for situations where the best approach is to describe something to another part of your code instead of directly writing instructions about what to do with it. Like, in a server-side web framework, there might be an area that registers handlers for the URLs it supports. Instead of calling an add handler method over and over, you could design a DSL for clients to declare each URL and its handler, and then your framework can register them automatically. Look for parts of your code that will be maintained by people whose primary job isn’t programming. Like, imagine you’re writing a text adventure game; only a few developers will work on most of the code, but the map of rooms will be updated by game designers, and NPC dialog will be added by writers. Maybe a DSL would make their jobs easier. And look for situations where you’ll get a lot of mileage out of the DSL. Libraries are a good example because they get used by many different clients. But a good DSL could also handle something in your project that you define a lot, or even just something you have to read or update frequently and you want to make that as easy as possible. Whatever reason you see to create a DSL, you need to balance it against the fact that it will not only take some effort for you to design and implement, it will also take some effort for its clients to learn. If methods and array literals are nearly as good as a DSL, they’re often the right answer, because Swift programmers will already know exactly how to use them. But sometimes, like in SwiftUI, a DSL is the right answer. So how do you make one? Well, let’s break down how Swift features are used together to build the SwiftUI DSL. In addition to Swift’s generally clean syntax, the SwiftUI DSL takes advantage of four things. Property wrappers. These let clients declare variables that are tied to DSL behavior. Trailing closure arguments. These let the DSL provide functions or initializers that read almost like custom syntax that’s been added to the language. Result builders. These collect the values computed in your DSL’s code into a return value so you can process them. And finally, modifier-style methods. These are basically just methods that return a wrapped or modified version of the value they’re called on; since result builders collect the values computed by your code, this pattern works really well with them. Now, property wrappers were already covered in the last half of this session from 2019, so I’m not going to talk much about them today. But these other three, and especially result builders, are going to be major topics of this session. Trailing closures and modifier-style methods are things a lot of Swift programmers are familiar with, but result builders are a more behind-the-scenes feature. So let’s talk about how they work so we can start building DSLs with them. Result builders are used to gather up the values created in your DSL and stitch them together into whatever data structure your language wants them in. They’re a bit like property wrappers in that you declare a special type and then you can use that type as an attribute. Specifically, you can apply a result builder to pretty much any function body with a return value, like a function or method, the getter of a computed property, or a closure. When you apply a result builder to a function body, Swift inserts various calls to static methods on the result builder. These end up capturing the results of statements that would otherwise have been discarded. So where Swift would normally ignore a return value, it instead gets passed to the result builder. These calls ultimately compute a value which is returned from the function body. So when you call the function, it executes all of the statements in that function normally, gathers up the values produced by them, and combines them into a single value that becomes the closure’s result. Result builders are a compile-time feature, so they work on any OS that your app will run on. The final version of the feature, from open-source Swift Evolution proposal 289, was included in Swift 5.4, so it shipped in Xcode 12.5 back in April. But prototypes of the feature were available before that, so you might see some older tutorials or libraries that use the prototype. Those will say \"function builder\" instead of \"result builder,\" and they might not quite match the final feature. So I pointed out the features used in the SwiftUI DSL before, but now let’s talk about how they work. I’ll be simplifying a few details -- like removing irrelevant parts of some SwiftUI types and showing some fake variable names like v0 for variables generated by the compiler -- but this should help you understand the basics. The first thing to realize is that, at the top level, this VStack thing with a block that looks like new syntax is actually a trailing closure argument. If we look up what VStack is, we find that it’s a struct in SwiftUI. So the trailing closure argument gets passed to this initializer on that struct. Now, when we look at the parameter the closure gets passed to, we notice that it has a ViewBuilder attribute on it. That attribute tells the compiler that it should apply the result builder named ViewBuilder to the closure. But what is ViewBuilder? Well, we look for a type by that name, and we find this type, again in SwiftUI. Note how it has an @resultBuilder attribute on it to tell the compiler that it’s a result builder. Now that Swift has located the result builder type, it starts applying it to the closure. The first thing it does is create variables for all of the statements that produce results. Once it’s created these variables, it writes a call to the buildBlock method in ViewBuilder and passes all of those variables to it. buildBlock’s job is to process or combine all of its parameters into a single value, which it returns. Then the compiler writes a return statement that returns buildBlock’s result from the closure. So basically, the compiler took your code and added the code in yellow so that the ViewBuilder could assemble all of the values you created into a single value that VStack will use as its content. Now, I’d like to point out how modifier-style methods fit into this. A modifier-style method returns either a modified copy of self or a copy of self wrapped in a different type that adds new behavior. And it does this within the same statement that created self in the first place. So it ends up changing the value before the result builder sees it. And you can call other modifier-style methods on that method’s result, so you can apply several changes and compose them together, all before the result builder ever sees the value. Those two things -- the ability to compose modifiers and the fact that they modify the value before the result builder sees it -- are why Swift DSLs often use modifiers. The two just work nicely together. Now, one thing we were worried about when we designed result builders was that, if they let you change Swift’s behavior too radically, clients wouldn’t be able to trust that anything in the DSL worked like normal Swift code. So when we designed result builders, we tried to strike a balance between having enough power to make a useful DSL and making sure that Swift’s features still work as clients expect them to. Result builders don’t radically reinterpret the code a client writes. Statements still end with newlines, calls still use parentheses, curly brackets still have to match up; all of the basics of Swift syntax work exactly the way your clients expect. They also don’t introduce new names that wouldn’t be visible from normal code written in the same place. There are some language features that don’t make much sense when you’re using a result builder -- mostly things like catch or break that interrupt control flow in ways that don’t really fit well into the idea of capturing and using statement results. Those features are disabled when you’re using a result builder. And there are some features -- like if, switch, and for-in statements -- that are disabled unless your result builder provides extra methods that are used to implement them. But if Swift allows you to use a keyword, it will work the way it normally does. You won’t end up with, like, if-else statements that run both the true and false blocks, or loops that skip some of the elements. Result builders just capture the statement results that would otherwise have been thrown away, nothing more. So clients can count on them, you know, making sense.",

I mean, I had to pinch myself, like, really hard to be assured that I'm not dreaming. Pretty much everyone that win Apple Design Award is somebody who has made something that I would use or play. It really gave the team a chance to pause and reflect and acknowledge all that we'd accomplished. It's elevated it to this other level where we've just got a lot more users, and we get a ton of feedback from people in all different countries. I can't say it's more like a dream come true because I-- this was beyond my dream and really can't express those things. This year with the Apple Design Awards, we're bringing back categories. There are six categories for the Apple Design Awards this year. -They're inclusivity. - Delight and fun. - Interaction. - Social impact. - Visuals and graphics. - And innovation.

Well, obviously ethnicity and age and gender are some of the big ones, but all the time, we're finding more things that are personally important to people. Being inclusive and being diverse is being accepting of those categories and making sure that they're represented in a way that's equitable to the user. Apps and games that excel at inclusivity include as many people as possible in the experience. This can be done through localization with a ton of languages. It can be done by supporting a wide variety of accessibility features like voiceover and dynamic type. It can be something as simple as turning on reduced motion in a game so people with motion sensitivities can still have fun and experience the game fully. ♪ ♪ The winning app in the Inclusivity category is Voice Dream Reader. Voice Dream Reader makes it so easy to bring text to speech. Mr. Bennet was so odd. A mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humor, reserve, and caprice...

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi. My name is Kasia Wawer. I'm an engineer on the Keyboards UI team, and today, I'll be your guide to the wonderful world of keyboard layout. I am incredibly excited to talk to you today about bringing the keyboard from a frame-based past into an auto-layout future. We'll start our tour by talking about the new guide. Then, we'll go over some of the new things you'll be able to do to more fully integrate the keyboard into your layout. And finally, we'll talk about what a keyboard really is-- philosophically speaking, types of keyboards to consider, and some of the cases you might not think about right away. So, let's get started with our tour. As with many things, this one begins in the ancient past. If you have worked with the keyboard in your app before, you know the way that it's been handled since time immemorial is by registering for notifications, deriving the appropriate offsets and animations from the information in the notification, doing some math, and finally, using that to adjust your layout. Now, notifications are sticking around. We are not deprecating them. You can learn more about them, if you're interested, in \"The Keys to a Better Text Input Experience\" from 2017. Let's look at a quick example of how notifications might be used with a custom guide. Now, don't copy any of this code because we're about to replace it. But here's how you handle the keyboard before iOS 15. You'd create your custom guide and anchors to respond to notifications. Then, you'd register for the appropriate notifications. Usually, at least willShow and willHide, but sometimes frame changes, etc. Then, you'd respond to said notifications by getting the frame information from the notification, making sure that you're adjusting for your own views and the safe area guide, if the keyboard is leaving the screen. And you'd get the animation info from the notification and, finally, change your guide to match. Now, it's not a ton, but it can get complicated quickly. Today, I am happy to announce a brand-new addition to the auto layout collection: UI keyboard layout guide. Now, try to constrain your excitement as we dive into this. Keyboard layout guide is brand-new in iOS 15. It's a layout guide. You can constrain the views and guides in your existing layout to it. If you're not familiar with layout guides, a layout guide is a way to represent space in a layout without using a view. It has all the same anchors as a view. The keyboard layout guide will represent the space that the keyboard occupies in your app so that your layout can account for it. And that's it! Mostly. Let's talk about updating that code we just saw to use this instead. Here's that notifications code. Don't copy it yet, wait for the green checkmark. So, now you can go ahead and remove that anchor you were tracking. And change from your layout guide to the view's keyboardLayoutGuide.",

Welcome to \"Understanding CPU Usage with Web Inspector.\" We all know that battery life is important to users, and you probably instinctively know the web browser is one of the most-used apps on our devices. But beyond that, web content is also incorporated into many popular iOS and macOS apps. That means web content significantly affects battery life for users, so making it power-efficient has a big impact. Safari and WebKit already provide features to automatically save power for users when possible, such as throttling timers when a webpage is in the background. And with support for content blocker extensions, users can automatically block loading unwanted content that's often just junk slowing down their browser, or worse, tracking them.",

    "video_transcript": "Bryan Eisenstadt: Thank you for joining today's session. We're excited to share some ideas around optimizing your subscription for success using the App Store's features to help you improve your subscriber acquisition. Let's begin with a brief introduction. I'm Bryan and I'm part of the App Store Monetization team based in Cupertino. Hemant Sawle: And I'm Hemant, a developer advocate on the App Store Commerce team, also based in Cupertino. Bryan: Today's session begins with an overview of acquisition offers and a recap of the tools the App Store has available to stand them up. We'll then spend some time walking through different acquisition strategies to consider, that utilize these features. And then I'll hand it over to Hemant to discuss engineering considerations. So let's get started. The App Store is the world's safest and most trusted app marketplace, serving over six hundred million people each week across more than 170 countries. Customers trust that apps and subscriptions on the platform are held to high standards for privacy, security, and content. And we now have more than 785 million active paid subscriptions across Apple services. Today, we're going to share some sample strategies that can help you attract customers to your subscription service. As a reminder, let's review the two subscription offer features that can be used for acquisition. Introductory offers is the feature that allows you to set a standard introductory price for new subscribers, shown here as \"1 WEEK FREE,\" before the subscription autorenews into the standard price. Offer codes takes the functionality of introductory offers a step further, allowing more flexibility for how you merchandise offers both inside and outside your app. Shown here, the custom code \"NEWYEAR\" unlocks a special offer inside of the app. And in fact, 60 percent of active paid subscriptions on the platform first began with an intro offer. So these can be quite powerful. But how do you know what to offer new customers? There are three different discount types you can choose from. Free trial, which gives customers free access to your subscription for an allotted period of time before they're billed. Pay up front, which gives customers a onetime discounted purchase for a period before renewing at the regular rate. And pay as you go, which gives customers multiple renewals at a discounted price before renewing at the regular rate. Keep in mind that offer should always be utilized as part of great customer experiences. Apps should never attempt to trick users into purchasing a subscription under false pretenses, cheat users with irrationally high prices, or engage in other scammy behavior. Apps must also provide ongoing value to customers in order to offer autorenewing subscriptions. Looking at a breakdown of the discount types redeemed by currently paying subscribers in all territories outside of Greater China, we see that nearly all of them began with a free trial. But when we look at the global view, you can see that nearly a quarter of active subscriptions began with a paid offer; either pay up front or pay as you go. In addition to their popularity in markets like Greater China where free trials are uncommon, paid offers can also be useful for apps with strong brand recognition or specific content-licensing considerations. Free trials are popular because they allow customers to sample a subscription service at no cost and are therefore a great tool for demonstrating the value of your service. Let's review some trends we observe when looking at how developers are using free trials today. The length of the free trial offered is one of the areas where we see some differences. We find that, at a platform level, the popularity of trial lengths that developers use varies based on their app's category. For example, entertainment, social, music, and book apps tend to overindex on one-month free trials. Apps in health and fitness, productivity, education, and weather tend to use weeklong trials more heavily. And three-day trials are most popular amongst photo and video, games, utilities, and business apps. We also observed some trends across the popularity of trial lengths that developers use, based on the region they're offered in. Monthly trials are most commonly offered in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Whereas Greater China, Japan, and LatAm all overindex in providing seven-day trials. And three-day trials are most popular in Southeast Asia and Pan EMEIA. Keep in mind that this data is directional, and you should always test and evaluate what makes most sense for your specific app and service. With some of the basics of acquisition offers under our belt, let's dive a little bit deeper and explore how offer tools can be used to support some sample strategies. To approach this, we've organized these strategies by onboarding and marketing; two areas you should be thinking about when developing your subscription. For each of these, we'll provide some strategies to consider and show you how to use the App Store's offer features to create them. So let's begin by discussing some ways you can optimize your app's onboarding to help you introduce your subscription to new users. One of the benefits of using an introductory offer is that it gives customers an accessible way to sample content before becoming paid subscribers. When customers are in this trial period, it's helpful to keep them engaged and exploring of the value of your service. In-app messaging and push notifications are tools that can help you reach new customers during their intro offer period. Remember that customers must opt into receiving push notifications from your app. Let's take a look at an example. Here you can see how the hypothetical app Ocean Journal offers to remind customers when their trial is ending to encourage them to take advantage of their remaining days of service. You can take this a step further by providing a timeline to customers before they subscribe to highlight key days to keep in mind throughout their free trial. This allows them to know exactly when they'll be charged. When used alongside notifications, timeline or countdown messaging can help customers comfortably explore your service and understand its value proposition, so they can make an informed decision about becoming a paying subscriber at the end of the free trial. Users who download your app have different interests and ambitions. When onboarding new users, you may want to learn a little about them so you can tailor your content and messaging to their needs. But do keep this short and sweet. A good rule of thumb is to provide onboarding that helps people enjoy your app, not just set it up. You can also consider using this information to surface and distribute offer codes for acquisition offers tailored directly to a customer's motivations. Here's an example of how personalized offer messaging might look with Ocean Journal. Here the app has included a question in their onboarding flow that helps them understand their customer's interests so they can better customize the customer's app experience. In the question shown here, they're looking to understand a user's surfing experience. If a user indicates that they're new to surfing, Ocean Journal can consider surfacing contextualized messaging like this \"Practice makes perfect\" copy alongside an offer code to help encourage users to commit to using the app to learn the sport. Next, consider offering longer term subscription plans as part of your subscription offering. Some of your customers may quickly understand the value of your service and be interested in committing to a longer term up front, especially when the option to do so is provided at a discounted price. When presented alongside clear messaging and an understanding of a service's value proposition, longer term SKUs can be an effective way to provide customers with long-term value. Across the platform, we observe that yearly and half-yearly SKUs are the most popular long-term offerings amongst customers today. You can still provide intro offers on these longer terms to provide an opportunity for customers to try out your app for free or at a reduced price before the subscription renews at the standard rate. Here you can see Ocean Journal's subscription options. They have both a yearly and monthly term available and use the intro offer feature to provide users with a seven-day free trial. They offer a 33 percent annual discount on their yearly SKU compared to monthly, so customers who choose yearly get an entire year of service for the price of eight months. In turn, this discounted offering is a benefit to Ocean Journal as it enables them to engage and retain customers for a longer period of time than they might on a monthly SKU. And here are some KPIs to keep in mind when developing these onboarding strategies. Consider monitoring your introductory offer conversion rate to understand how many customers convert to paid subscribers after the introductory offer period. Retention rate can help you understand the amount of customers that renew their subscriptions. And tracking subscription activations can help you evaluate the total number of new customers subscribing to your service.",

    "video_transcript": "Michael Caldarone: Hi, everyone. I'm Michael Caldarone from App Store Games Business Management. Today's developer session is called \"Get started with in-app events.\" We're looking forward to sharing more about this exciting new feature with all of you today. We'll begin with a brief introduction to the concept of events and how they will look when showcased on the App Store. Then we will walk through how to set up in-app events in App Store Connect. Using the information we walk through in the first two sections, we'll put it all together in some examples. In-app events is a new feature that transforms discovery and rediscovery on the App Store, giving you new ways to showcase your events and expand their reach. But what are we talking about when we talk about events? They are timely activities within your apps and games, such as a game competition, a fitness challenge, a movie premiere, and more. In fact, many of you may already be running events inside your apps and games. For those of you who aren't, now is a great time to consider doing so. That's because now events are discoverable right on the App Store. So how can events benefit your business? Events can help you attract new users and drive new downloads, keep active users engaged by providing new content and functionality within your app or game, and reactivate lapsed users by giving them reasons to come back, even after a long absence. Later in this session, we'll dig deeper into these concepts. On iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 or later, events appear across the App Store as event cards. Event cards include images or video as well as the event name and short description. Event cards appear on your product page, where events are listed in order of their start date and priority. People who have previously downloaded your app or game, including those who have deleted it, will see them above your screenshots, as seen here, while users who have not downloaded your app will see your event cards below your screenshots. Users can tap the event card to open an event details page, as seen on the right here. If they do not already have the app or game, they can download it from the event card by tapping the Get button. If someone already has your app installed, they can tap Open to launch your app straight to your event. The event details page, with its longer description and larger media asset, gives users additional context around your event. To help you build anticipation for your event, you can publish them on the App Store up to 14 days before the event starts. Customers can also opt in to be notified when your event starts. These notifications come from the App Store and will launch customers directly into the event inside your app or game. If the user doesn't have your app or game installed, they'll be directed to the event details page. To help you market your events off-store and provide a seamless experience for App Store customers, we generate an App Store URL for each event. This URL directs the user to your event details page, and will fall back to your App Store product page after your event has ended and for customers on older OS versions. The event card is discoverable across the App Store. In addition to your product page, they are also discoverable in Search. On the Games and Apps tabs, users will see personalized event recommendations that can help them stay informed about the apps and games they already have, find something new, or rediscover an old favorite. And lastly, our editorial team will be curating the most exciting and innovative events on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs. When users search for your app, game, or event, it can appear in search results. This helps users, including those who have lapsed, more easily discover the events happening in your app or game. As you see here on the left, if a user that has not downloaded your app or game searches for it, they will see screenshots alongside your app icon. Moving to the center, if a user who currently has or has previously downloaded your app or game searches for it, they will see your in-app event card alongside your app icon and name. Users can also search directly for an event. On the right, you'll see a user searched for \"june leaderboard climb\", and the Mountain Climber app and the event card displayed in results, regardless of user state. So now that we've shown you what events look like on the App Store, let's talk about how you can set up your own. We've created a robust set of tools to help you set up your in-app events and showcase them to the right audience. We've also updated the App Review submission experience to give you more flexibility around submitting new events without a new app version. We're gradually rolling out this new experience, so in order to create in-app events, you'll need to make sure someone in your organization with an Account Holder role has enabled the new submission experience in App Store Connect. Later this year, all users will be updated to the new experience. Keep in mind that while marketing roles can create events, only App Manager, Admin, or Account Holders can submit events. Once the new submission flow has been enabled, you'll see the new In-App Events section, where you can create and manage your events.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, I’m Nate, an engineer on the Swift team here at Apple. Today my colleague Robert and I will tell you about async/await in Swift. Asynchronous programming is a regular activity for many of you. So you know it’s all too easy to write asynchronous code that’s verbose, complex, and even incorrect. Async/await in Swift can help out. Using it, you can write asynchronous code just as easily as you write regular code. And when you do, your code will better reflect your ideas. It’ll be safer too. On top of that, the SDK has hundreds of awaitable methods available for you to use. For example, UIKit provides functionality to form a thumbnail from a UIImage. In fact, it provides both synchronous and asynchronous functions to complete that task.",

I'll be presenting a host of new camera features beginning with minimum focus distance reporting; how to capture 10-bit HDR video; the main course, Video Effects in Control Center; and then -- a brief respite from new features -- I'll review strategies to get the best performance out of your camera app. And lastly, I'll introduce a brand-new performance trick for your bag, IOSurface compression. All of the features I'll be describing today are found in the AVFoundation framework -- specifically, the classes prefixed with AVCapture. To briefly review, the main objects are AVCaptureDevices, which represent cameras or microphones; AVCaptureDeviceInputs, which wrap devices, allowing them to be plugged into an AVCaptureSession, which is the central control object of the AVCapture graph. AVCaptureOutputs render data from inputs in various ways. The MovieFileOutput records QuickTime movies. The PhotoOutput captures high-quality stills and Live Photos. Data outputs, such as the VideoDataOutput or AudioDataOutput, deliver video or audio buffers from the camera or mic to your app. There are several other kinds of data outputs, such as Metadata and Depth. For live camera preview, there's a special type of output, the AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer, which is a subclass of CALayer. Data flows from the capture inputs to compatible capture outputs through AVCaptureConnections, represented here by these arrows. If you're new to AVFoundation camera capture, I invite you to learn more at the Cameras and Media Capture start page on developer.apple.com. OK, let's dive right into the first of our new features. Minimum focus distance is the distance from the lens to the closest point where sharp focus can be attained. It's an attribute of all lenses, be they on DSLR cameras or smartphones. iPhone cameras have a minimum focus distance too, we've just never published it before... ...until now, that is. Beginning in iOS 15, minimum focus distance is a published property of iPhone autofocus cameras. Here's a sampling of recent iPhones. The chart illustrates how the minimum focus distance of the Wide and telephoto cameras varies from model to model. There's a notable difference between the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max Wide cameras, the Pro Max focusing at a minimum distance of 15 centimeters compared to 12 on the Pro. This is due to the sensor shift stabilization technology in the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Likewise, the minimum focus distance of the tele is farther on the 12 Pro Max than the 12 Pro. This is due to the longer reach of the telephoto lens. It has a 2.5x versus a 2x zoom. Let me show you a quick demo of why minimum focus distance reporting is important.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Daniel Sykes-Turner: Hi, my name is Daniel Sykes-Turner and I'm an accessibility engineer. In this talk, my colleague Virata and I are going to go over some of the accessibility features on watchOS and how you as a developer can build your watch apps to support the people who use these features. In today's talk, you'll first be introduced to accessibility on watchOS. Then I'll dive into the accessibility APIs and show you what you can do to support different types of visual accessibility. And finally, Virata will walk you through how motor accessibility works on the watch and what you can do to support it. Let's get started with accessibility on watchOS. Accessibility is about people using their devices in the way that's best for them. And that means, to give your app the best user experience, accessibility must be considered. On the Apple Watch, we have a large suite of accessibility features that can make using your app easier. For example, assistive technologies such as VoiceOver allow people with visual impairments full use of their Apple Watch by navigating a screen using a series of gestures and taps while content is read back to them. And brand new on watchOS this year is AssistiveTouch, which has been reimagined specifically for the Apple Watch. AssistiveTouch allows those with motor impairments to use their Apple Watch without the need to touch the screen at all. Virata will show you how this works later on and what you can do to support it. watchOS also offers several display accommodations such as Reduce Motion, Bold Text, and also new this year, large accessibility text sizes. Let's talk about visual accessibility on watchOS. Supporting accessibility with the right APIs will ensure that VoiceOver functions correctly for your users, regardless of whether your app is written with WatchKit or SwiftUI. This talk will focus on accessibility for SwiftUI. However, know that all the principles you learn here will apply to WatchKit as well. And when making your apps accessible, don't forget about complications and notifications. Complications and dynamic notifications also need to support our assistive technologies, as they act as another path delivering content from your app. Now, isn't the best way to learn something new to build an app? Luckily I've become quite invested in growing plants at home so I decided to go ahead and build an app to help take care of them. Now, it's not quite finished, but on the main screen here I have all the information on my plants, including an upcoming schedule of plant care tasks: water in five days, fertilize in seven days, and keep in a medium amount of sunlight. I have a few other plants in the list here, too. Then for each plant, I have two buttons that I can use to log a task such as when I water or fertilize. And by tapping on the cell, I can adjust the number of days between watering and fertilizing. Since this is an informative app, each cell contains a fair amount of text. Here I'm showing you what the app looks like when the system text size is at its default size; it looks pretty good. But if I change the system text size to extra small, as shown on the left, you'll notice that while the buttons and the task list text resizes, the plant name title stays the same size. Then when I move up to accessibility extra large on the right, the task list text size has grown so large that it has truncated and no longer fits all the information on the screen. Let's take a look at how our app can better support Dynamic Type. If I inspect the code for my PlantView, I have a VStack with the title and other content inside. Notice the font I've used for my title is using a fixed font size. That's definitely going to stop my title from changing size. Rather than using a fixed font size, I should be using one of the 11 text styles provided. The text styles on the left are displayed at the default system text size. And when scaled up to the largest text size, they grow to the size of the text styles on the right. By using a text style, the system will automatically adjust the font size with the system text size settings. So if I take a look at my PlantView code again, I can make that change quickly and easily by changing my title font to the title3 text style for a smaller-sized title. Next let's fix the truncating text in the task list. In the code for my PlantTaskLabel, I'm assigning a lineLimit of 1 to everything in the HStack, which only allows the text to expand over a single line. To give your UI the flexibility to adjust to as many lines as needed, set the lineLimit to the maximum number of lines you need to support. Or remove it to allow an unlimited number of lines. Now we're making progress. But while the UI certainly is larger and there's no more truncation, in the process it's become a lot more crowded. And it's still not easy to read the information on the screen. Sometimes layouts for larger text styles just need to be structured differently. So when building the layout, I'll create an Environment property wrapper on the sizeCategory to get updates whenever this changes. Next, I just need to adjust my UI to depend on the sizeCategory. In this case, the text in the task list starts wrapping somewhere around extraExtraLarge. So if the size category is less than this, I'll use the PlantView we've seen before. But if it's larger, I'll use this new vertical plant view that stacks each of my labels and buttons, giving them much more space to grow. That looks much better. With the introduction of large accessibility text styles on the watch, we expect to see a lot more people making use of Dynamic Type -- and so should you! For people setting up their Apple Watch, they will now see the option to customize the text size when getting started. And if they don't make any changes, the watch will automatically pick the closest size to what is used on the phone. So to recap Dynamic Type, there are three key things to make sure watch apps behave great with larger text sizes. First, you want to make sure to always use a text style, not a fixed font size. Second, allow your text to wrap to avoid truncating. And third, when necessary, switch to a vertically stacked layout when the content becomes too crowded. Since this only scratches the surface on large text, I'd strongly recommend you check out the talk, \"Building apps with Dynamic Type\" to really step up your game. And to learn even more about making great visual experiences, be sure to check out the talk, \"Make your app visually accessible.\" OK, so visually, that works great. But what if I weren't a visual user? Let's turn on VoiceOver and have a listen to what the experience is like.",

Today, I want to talk about the improvements the team has made to breakpoints that will make your debugging more productive. Let’s start with some breakpoint basics to get everyone on the same page. When you encounter a bug in your program, it means it is not executing to your expectation, and you want to check with the debugger why reality has diverged. At this point, there are two common activities that you do. One, you inspect the process state to further understand the situation. Two, you ascertain your logic by stepping through the process execution. Both activities require you to pause, ideally just before the bug happens. And the best way to pause the process is to use a breakpoint. We're going to talk about three common breakpoints that you can create in Xcode. The first is source file breakpoints. These are breakpoints that are set in a single file. The most common type is the line breakpoint. It is the workhorse of breakpoints and is excellent for pausing on a line of code you want to inspect. The fastest way to create one is simply to click in the gutter, right next to the line you want to pause. Suppose at this point, I would like to check the logic of function convertedToVolume by stepping into it.",

    "video_description": "Discover how Apple creates products that work well for everyone. Learn from a few of the engineers and designers who helped build Apple Watch as they share stories that highlight our approach to accessible design, constant iteration, and community engagement.",
    "video_resources": "[]",
    "video_resources-href": "",
    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ So our goals have always been to build great accessibility into all of our products because many of us navigate our lives in different ways. At Apple, we like to think of accessibility touching four different broad categories-- vision, cognitive, motor, and hearing. And we look at all those segments and try to think about how they impact each product. Are we doing something in this area where we should have a different accommodation? Do we have something that we need a special assistive technology to provide a different way to interact with this device? How do we make the whole world accessible? Every day, we're thinking about accessibility. We care because they push the boundaries of the experience in a way that we can't imagine. If you can create not just a good accessibility experience, but a great accessibility experience, you'll have a fan for life. The Watch is a unique kind of computing platform. It's very personal. It touches your skin. It also has a long history of what its use is for, and what its functions are. To make it something accessible, you really wanna look at-- what is the product supposed to do? What is its core mission of what this is gonna bring value for? So when you look at that for the Watch, that's when we start to realize, like, all right, how do we make this more accessible for someone who's blind? What do we do for someone who's low-vision? And how do we do it on a CPU the size of a postage stamp? Apple developed this product, and the primary focus was to be able to read the time, and so the contrast with the black background with the legible letters was very important. Well, it turns out that was also important for low-vision users, and it's great for the person who needs that accessibility, but it also turns out to be useful for everyone else. So one of the great things about making a product accessible by design is that you do things that you may not think are necessary, and I'm reminded of a story of a woman that I met who had Usher syndrome. So she came to us and said, \"You know, what's really great about the Watch is that I can read the email on this really small screen because all my vision is focused in this central area. It's actually better than having a big screen.\" When you sort of invest in accessibility, you have to look at things from a different perspective, and so that often leads to features that become mainstream over time, and I think the Apple Watch is a great example of showing a lot of those things, from the large-type watch face which was designed for low-vision users but it's available for everybody. Part of the thing about making the Watch accessible is what is the primary function? One of those things was telling the time quickly, and sometimes discreetly, so that's where Taptic Time came into play, which is a feature that we have that allows a user to feel out the time using the haptics played back to them. When we were testing, one of the things that I noticed right away sort of walking around and using the device, if I was mobile, I had to take one hand off of my cane, stop, and then touch my device. And I thought, \"Well, that could be very dangerous, right?\" So one of the things I thought is, \"Man, it would be really great if I could -just raise my hand...\" - 1:04 p.m. - And hear the time, and then I don't have to stop or jeopardize my safety.",

    "video_transcript": "In this presentation we will focus on imageblocks, which allow you to describe image data in tile memory that the GPU can manipulate efficiently. Imageblocks provide optimized access to image data residing in tile memory. And with the A11 GPU, we're giving you direct control of it. You will be able to lay out pixels in the way that makes sense to your application, as well as move data explicitly to and from it. Imageblocks are deeply integrated with fragment processing and the new tile shading stage. They are also available to traditional compute. No matter which stage you're in, imageblocks are recommended for representing your images because they optimize access to grids of 2D data. Imageblocks are a key building block for several of the other features we'll discuss in this presentation series. Let's start by defining imageblocks more precisely. An Imageblock is a 2D data structure in tile memory. It has width, height, and a pixel depth. Fragment functions can only access a single pixel that corresponds to its location. Compute kernels, on the other hand, have access to the entire imageblock. Each pixel can be quite complex, consisting of multiple components, and each component can be addressed as its own image plane. This allows adjacent components to be efficiently stored to one or more textures in device memory as bulk operations. Imageblocks also provide bulk access to the GPU's format conversion hardware. Floating point pixels will be converted to the destination texture format when stored to device memory. Let's now take a closer look at one of the benefits of using imageblocks, accelerating image data movement out of tile memory. Prior to imageblocks, you probably moved portions of your textures into threadgroup memory before operating on them, one pixel at a time. But the GPU didn't understand that you were operating on image data, so you also had to store those pixels back out to device memory textures, one pixel at a time. With imageblocks, you can instead store the image data using a single operation, which is much more efficient. Now let's turn to how you describe imageblock properties to Metal. In a compute pass, you describe the imageblock's width and height using the API shown here. The dimensions can be different for each dispatch. The imageblock's pixel depth is described in the shading language as a structure. The entire imageblock is made available as an argument whose type is templated by that struct. Let's take a closer look at the shading language syntax. In this example, we are describing a pixel consisting of three elements, each with a varying number of components. The imageblock is made available to the kernel as an argument. Kernels access any location within the imageblock by reference using the data method, which takes the location as its argument and returns a pointer to a new address space called threadgroup_imageblock. With a reference to a particular location, we can read and write to elements at that location. I mentioned earlier that imageblocks are laid out in planes that can be stored efficiently to device memory textures. In the shading language, we call adjacent planes that can be stored together a slice. Let's take a look at an example kernel. In this example, we've loaded a source texture into an imageblock, performed some image processing on that block, and are ready to store the color elements out to a destination texture. We only need one thread of our threadgroup to perform the write, so we must first barrier to ensure all threads have finished processing the imageblock. Notice that Metal adds a new memory target for the barrier, declaring that we only need to wait for writes on the imageblock to complete. We then acquire our desired slice from the imageblock using the slice method. The slice method takes a reference to any pixel element that's part of the slice. Finally, we write the slice to the destination texture.",

    "video_transcript": "The ClockKit framework allows you to display your app’s data on the watch face. These areas are called complications. Complications are a great way to connect people to their favorite apps with every wrist raise and keep them informed throughout their day. Complications can also be tapped for quick access into the app. With Apple Watch Series 4, we’re adding new complication capabilities to ClockKit, which allow you to create engaging, full-color complications for the new Infograph and Infograph Modular watch faces. On the Infograph watch face, these new complications can extend into the corners of the incredible new display. On the Infograph Modular watch face, you can now present even more of your app’s information in full-color, right in the middle of the watch face. Complications are divided into families. These determine how information is presented onscreen. On Apple Watch Series 4, we’ve added four new families: Graphic Corner, Graphic Circular, Graphic Bezel, and Graphic Rectangular. Each complication family uses system-defined templates to determine how the information is laid out, like the Graphic Circular family seen here. There are many templates for you to choose from to display your data. The complication family templates each consist of different combinations of data provider classes from the ClockKit framework, from text to images to the all-new gauges. For the Infograph and Infograph Modular watch faces, we’ve added a new full-color image provider and a new gauge provider. Let’s learn about these. First is the all-new gauge provider. Gauge providers allow you to show progress completed or a value within a range to the user in different ways, depending on the complication template family you are using. You can also use a time interval gauge to automatically animate the values as they change, as you see here with the timer complication. With gauge providers, you can provide a single color or you can provide a gradient, specifying the gradient colors along the gauge. You can also specify whether the color or gradient will fill the gauge as the data progresses or if it’s a range and uses a ring to indicate the value. Next, we have image providers. Image providers allow you to display a tintable image or a one-color image for use on existing watch faces, and now on the Infograph and Infograph Modular watch faces, full color images. Finally, we have text providers, which allow you to use text throughout the various templates. They can be used to display text, dates, time, time ranges, and even automatic countdowns or count-ups between two dates or times. In a handful of complication family templates, you can also now use multiple text providers together, each with their own tint color, to make one multi-purpose string. This can be really useful if your app has specific branding for different pieces of data. Now that you’re familiar with the gauge, image, and text providers, let’s look at the new graphic complication family templates available on the Infograph and Infograph Modular watch faces and learn how to combine providers to display your data in different ways. The first new complication family template is the Graphic Corner. This is available for use on the Infograph watch face. This template curves along the corner of the display to allow for more content like never before. The Graphic Corner templates have a handful of different combinations of providers to use. You can use a gauge provider with text, a gauge provider with an image, a set of text providers, a text provider with an image. And finally, you can use a full-color image by itself. Now, for consistency with other corner complications, it’s recommended that you use providers that will curve around the display. OK, let’s look at a code example of how to create a graphic corner complication that uses a gauge provider with text. Let’s make something similar to the Weather app.",

    "video_transcript": "Jaap van Muijden: Welcome to Metal Enhancements for A13 Bionic. My name is Jaap van Muijden, from the GPU Software team at Apple. Today I’m going to introduce you to the latest Apple-designed GPU in the A13 Bionic, and the new Metal features it enables. I will then then show you how to use those features to reduce your app’s memory usage, and optimize its run-time performance. The new A13 Bionic continues the rapid evolution of Apple-designed GPUs by focusing on three major areas: general performance, architectural improvements that better meet the evolving needs of modern apps, and advanced Metal features. Let’s take a look at each. The GPU in A13 Bionic is almost three times faster than the A10 Fusion in general performance, and builds on the great performance improvements of the A11 and A12 Bionic GPUs. Existing apps run faster on the A13 and can complete each frame in less time, which in turn leads to power savings and extended app usage. The Apple-designed GPU architecture has quickly evolved to better meet the demands of modern apps. Beginning with the A11, the 16-bit floating point and texturing rates were increased to alleviate common bottlenecks in games, and the numerical accuracy of 32-bit floating point operations were improved to better handle advanced compute workloads. The A12 GPU greatly improves memory bandwidth by losslessly compressing and decompressing texture content to and from memory. It also adds dedicated hardware to support the user interface, ensuring even faster response times, but also reducing the impact of UI elements on foreground apps. And the A12 and later GPUs enhance the iPad experience by sharing its resources between apps more efficiently. And now we have the A13 GPU. The A13 GPU architecture greatly improves the processing of high dynamic range content on the GPU, by doubling the rate of 16-bit floating point operations and adding support for small 16-bit numbers that better preserve black levels. The A13 GPU also provides significantly better support for independent compute work that executes concurrently with rendering workloads. Apple-designed GPUs have supported this asynchronous compute capability since the A9, but the A13 GPU takes it to the next level by adding more hardware channels and minimizing impact to the more deadline-sensitive rendering tasks. Now before we describe the new Metal features of the A13, let’s also quickly recap some of the major Metal features introduced on the A11 and A12 GPUs. Let’s start with the A11. Tile shading, imageblocks, and persistent threadgroup memory all are features designed to explicitly leverage Apple’s tile-based deferred rendering architecture and work together to optimize the bandwidth usage of many modern rendering techniques. Rasterization order groups allow you to manage complex, per-pixel data structures on the GPU, and color rate control optimizes the use of multi-sample anti-aliasing in advanced rendering algorithms. And now on to the A12. Layered rendering lets each rendered primitive target a unique slice of a 2D texture array, while multi-viewport rendering lets each primitive do the same for up to 16 viewports and scissor rectangles. Stencil feedback lets each fragment set a unique stencil reference value for advanced per-pixel effects, while stencil resolve allows for stencil buffer reuse across MSAA and non-MSAA passes. And although lossless compression is enabled by default wherever possible, Metal also provides direct control over in-place compression and decompression of shared storage mode textures when optimal readback is required. So now let’s introduce the new Apple GPU Family 6 that supports the A13 GPU. Sparse textures enable higher-quality texture streaming for open-world games at a fixed memory budget, by tracking the most important regions of each texture and then mapping only those regions to memory. Rasterization rate maps focus high-quality rasterization and shading to the image areas that matter most, while reducing rates elsewhere, saving both memory and performance. Vertex amplification eliminates redundant vertex processing that would otherwise occur with layered renders that share geometry. GPU-driven pipelines enable you to draw larger and more immersive scenes, and with argument buffer tier 2, apps can execute their GPU-driven workloads more flexibly than ever before. SIMD group instructions optimize sharing and synchronization among the threads of an SIMD group during shading. And ASTC HDR brings high-quality lossy compression to high-dynamic range textures, saving significant memory and bandwidth. Let’s look at each of these in more detail, starting with sparse textures. Sparse textures is a brand new feature introduced on the A13 GPU that let you control the storage and residency of Metal textures at a fine granularity. Sparse textures are not fully resident in memory. But instead, you can allocate sections of them on a special memory heap called a sparse heap. Here you can see two sparse textures that have parts of their data allocated in such a sparse heap. A single heap can provide storage for many sparse textures, all sharing a single pre-allocated pool of memory. All sparse textures are split up in units called sparse tiles, which have the same memory footprint independent of texture resolution or pixel format. So what are the applications of this feature? One of them is texture streaming. Texture streaming lets you render incredibly large scenes with a fixed memory footprint by loading only the texture mipmaps that are needed for the current view. With traditional texture streaming, individual mipmaps are loaded when required and evicted when no longer needed, or when more important textures need the memory. Texture streaming traditionally manages texture residency at mipmap granularity. The lowest levels of the mipmap pyramid are kept resident in case a higher quality mipmap is requested, but not yet streamed in. It may not be available yet because the loading operation has not completed, or there is insufficient allocated streaming memory. Having the lowest level mipmaps available ensures that there is always some valid data to sample, even though it is of lower resolution. Metal’s sparse texture feature improves on this texture streaming model in two ways. First, sparse textures provide texture access counters that you can use to determine how often each region of a sparse texture is accessed. This lets you prioritize texture loading, as regions that are accessed more often by the renderer are generally more visible in the current view. Secondly, residency can be managed at the sparse tile granularity instead of mipmap granularity. This lets you be even more efficient with your texture memory, and allows for more visible texture detail where it counts. Taken together, sparse textures let you stream more visible detail with the same memory budget, improving quality. Now let’s look at how you create and use sparse textures in Metal. To start using sparse textures, you first create a sparse heap and then allocate one or more textures from it. New sparse textures are created initially without any mapped sparse tiles. You need to request memory mappings from the heap using the GPU. The memory is mapped in tile-sized units called sparse tiles, similar to virtual memory pages. Likewise, you need request the GPU to unmap tiles when they are no longer needed. Sampling a sparse texture works just like a regular texture, and sampling unmapped regions return zeros. Finally, the texture access counters can be read back from a sparse texture, to get estimates for how often each tile is accessed, so that you can precisely control and prioritize when you map tiles for your textures. Let’s look at each of these steps in more detail. Here we have some Metal code that creates a sparse texture heap with a given memory size. We first calculate the size of our heap, and make sure it is a multiple of the sparse tile size. Here we use a local helper function to round up our data size to the nearest multiple of the sparse tile size. We can then generate the sparse heap descriptor; we set the heap type to sparse, and specify the size of our heap in bytes. We then create the sparse heap using our MTLDevice object. Creating a sparse texture is very easy. First, we create a texture descriptor as normal, and then we create the texture using the sparse heap object. Now that we have seen how you can create the sparse texture, let’s take a look at how to map regions onto memory. The mapping and unmapping of regions of a texture is done by encoding map and unmap commands in a resource state command encoder. This encoder can be used to schedule the map and unmap operations on the GPU timeline, similar to encoding other render commands in Metal. Let’s see how this looks in code. First we create the encoder. And then we simply encode a map operation; we specify the texture and what regions, slice, and mip level of the texture we want to map. The region is now mapped, and you can blit or create your texture data onto the mapped memory. To unmap a section, we follow the same procedure; the only difference is the mode of the update we encode. Now that you have created and mapped our texture data, let’s move on to the sampling of sparse textures. Sampling from a sparse texture is no different than sampling from a normal texture. There is well-defined behavior in case an unmapped section is accessed. Sampling an unmapped region returns a vector of zeroes, and any writes are discarded. In addition to the standard sampling functions, Metal provides a sparse_sample function that can be used in shaders to test for unmapped regions. Now that you’ve seen how to create, map, and sample sparse textures, let’s look at a simple implementation. One way to efficiently sample sparse textures is to perform fallback sampling. In your shader, you can first try to fetch texels using the sparse_sample method, and if that fails, you can fall back to a lower-level mipmap. By always keeping the lower mipmap loaded, you are guaranteed to find a valid sample. And to better support fallback sampling, the Metal shading language also supports a new argument on texture methods called min LOD clamp. Min LOD clamp lets you set the highest mipmap in the chain that can be accessed. This lets you guarantee a valid sample by specifying the highest mipmap that you know you have data for. Let’s look at that in code. Here we have a fragment shader that samples from a sparse texture. You start sampling your sparse texture using the sparse_sample method, which returns a sparse_color object. You can then call the resident method on the returned object to determine if the GPU sampled mapped data. If it did, you retrieve the sampled value and return it. Otherwise you sample the sparse texture again, but this time with an LOD clamp to force the sampler to bypass higher mipmaps. Since you guaranteed that this mipmap and lower mipmaps have data, the second sampling call is made using the normal sample method. Now that you’ve seen the functions for mapping and sampling sparse texture data, let’s talk a little bit about how to decide when to map or free sparse texture tiles. Traditional texture streaming systems manually collect app-level statistics to help prioritize texture residency. These methods are often coarse at the mipmap or mesh granularity to help manage the overhead. Metal instead supports a fine-grained solution called texture access counters. These counters accurately track how often sparse tiles are accessed by the GPU with very low overhead. Texture access counters are queried from the GPU. Let’s look at how this works. This Metal example will collect the texture access counters from the GPU. You start by creating a buffer to contain the sampled counters. And then you encode a blit to copy the counters from our sparse texture to our buffer, specifying the mip level, slice, and region you’re interested in. Traditional texture streaming techniques have served us very well over the years, and given a fixed memory budget, we can stream in the mip levels for the textures that user sees. When the texture budget gets exhausted, we can no longer stream in higher resolution mip levels and we start seeing uniformly blurry textures. But with sparse textures, you can now get a better usage of your memory. You can map the memory to make room for the individual texture tiles that the user sees, at the quality level that is most appropriate for each texture tile within a given mip level. This allows you to distribute texture memory for the tiles that make the most visual impact. Additionally, this feature saves bandwidth when streaming textures, as the sparse texture API allows you to map and unmap individual tiles instead of having to copy and rearrange entire mipmap chains in memory during streaming. That’s it for sparse textures, a really important memory optimization that will also improve texture streaming quality. Now let’s move on to the runtime optimization technique called rasterization rate maps. Rasterization rate maps let you make better use of Retina displays by rasterizing and shading the image areas that matter most at highest resolution, while reducing quality where it's not perceived. Rasterization rate maps let you rasterize and shade at multiple resolutions by defining both a screen space and physical render target size, and a nonuniform mapping between the two spaces, to control the quality of each region. The physical resolution is smaller than the screen space, saving bandwidth and reducing the memory footprint. And the nonuniform mapping results in higher-quality visuals than the uniform upscale often used in games at a fraction of the cost of rendering the entire screen at native resolution. Let’s take a closer look at how this works. Here is a screenshot of a diffuse layer from the g-buffer of a sample renderer. Traditional rendering draws geometry by calculating the screen space coordinates of each vertex, and then rasterizing the resulting primitives in screen space to produce fragments. These screen space coordinates have a one-to-one mapping to the coordinates of the physical render target during rasterization. With rasterization rate maps, you can configure the rasterizer to map screen space coordinates unevenly when creating fragments thus reducing the number of total fragments produced and simultaneously rendering to a smaller render target. In both images, the white grid corresponds to an evenly spaced grid in virtual screen space. But as you can see here, it is distributed unevenly in physical space. In this example, we’ve used rasterization rate maps to keep the screen resolution in the center of the screen, but reducing it towards the edges of the screen. To see this more clearly, let’s zoom in on one of the center tiles. The resolution of this physical tile matches the resolution of the same region within the g-buffer. But as you move towards the edge of the screen, the quality is reduced by effectively reducing the physical space dedicated to that tile. This leads to a distorted image in your physical image, but we will show that this mapping can be reversed to create an undistorted final image. But first, let’s take a look at how the mappings are defined. The mapping is defined as two 1D functions in the X and Y axes of the screen space. You describe these functions in Metal using a series of control points defining the quality requirements. In this image, we can see the effective rasterization rate across the screen, given our two 1D functions along the axis. A quality level of one means that fragment shader is invoked for every screen space pixel along the axis. And a quality level of .5 means that for at least 50 percent of the pixels, a fragment shader is invoked along a given axis. A quality level of zero means that each fragment shader will be invoked at the minimum rate supported by Metal. Metal will resample these control points to create a final rate map. Even though you don’t control the final mapping directly, Metal guarantees that your minimum quality is preserved. Now let’s create this mapping with Metal. Here is the Metal code that builds the rasterization rate map you just saw. First, you define the rasterization function. In this example we will use the five values we showed previously for both the horizontal and vertical axis of our map. You then fill the layer descriptor to describe the quality across our rasterization rate map. You then create one by providing the horizontal and vertical quality functions. With your quality defined, you now create a Metal rasterization rate map descriptor from the layer descriptor and our final screen space resolution. Finally, you use your Metal device to instantiate a rasterization rate map object using that descriptor. Next we need to create the physical render target for this map. Because the actual rasterization rate map rates are implementation dependent, you need to first query the physical size of the resource from the map. You then create the physical render target as usual: specify the correct usage and storage properties, and instantiate the texture using your Metal device object. Finally, you combine the created texture and rasterization map to set up your render pass and render as usual. And with that, you have rasterized your g-buffer nonuniformly. But what about shading the g-buffer in later passes? With a traditional deferred shading pipeline, you can continue lighting with the same rasterization rate map because your light geometry will get correctly rasterized in the same screen space as your g-buffer. With tiled deferred renderers, you will need to do a little more work. If you’re not already familiar with the tiled deferred rendering, please see our Modern Rendering with Metal talk at WWDC 2019. With tiled deferred, your render target's physical space is split into equally sized blocks of pixels and each block performs light tile culling and shading. In the presented image, our sample code shows a heat map for the number of lights per block of 32 by 32 pixels. Because screen space no longer corresponds to physical space, integrating rasterization rate maps with tiled deferred renderers requires one additional step. The lighting shader will need to transform the pixel coordinates in physical space to the virtual screen space. This is the reverse mapping used during rasterization. Let’s take a look at how you can perform this reverse mapping in your shaders. First you have to make the rasterization rate map parameters accessible to the shader. To do this, first you create a MTLBuffer that can hold the parameters. You then copy the parameter data into a MTLBuffer. And finally, bind the MTLBuffer to your shader. Now that the map is bound, let’s use it. In the shader, you now have access to a rasterization_rate_map_data object at the corresponding buffer bind point. You can use that object to instantiate a rasterization_rate_map _decoder object. And then use the decoder to transform between the physical and screen coordinates. Returning to our tiled deferred renderer, we use the decoder to perform tile culling in the virtual screen space. Adapting your light culling to virtual screen space means your tiles are no longer square, but now follow the correct area in screen space. Let’s compare this heat map to the full, uniform resolution render. And back to the rasterization rate map version. As you can see, with rasterization rate maps, we’ve significantly reduced the amount of shaded tiles on our screen. Finally, let’s consider how rasterization rate maps are prepared for compositing and final presentation. Before displaying the final image to the screen, you need to unwrap it using a full screen pass that transforms the physical space texture to a high-resolution surface using the shader mapping just described. As you can see, it is very difficult to notice the quality trade-offs despite the aggressive falloffs that were chosen for this sample. We expect rasterization rate maps to be combined with other techniques, such as depth of field, to hide the quality tradeoff. That’s it for rasterization rate maps. Let’s move on to vertex amplification. Vertex amplification lets you reduce geometry processing in multi-view rendering cases. Multi-layer and multi-viewport rendering reduce the number of draw calls needed to target each view using instancing. But that doesn’t eliminate the GPU cost of processing each of these instances. Many multi-layer and multi-viewport rendering techniques share geometry between views. For example, between the cascades of shadow maps or the sides of an environment map. Each of those instances typically transform that geometry in almost the same way. So even though the position is unique per view, attributes such as normals, tangents, and texture coordinates are identical. Vertex amplification lets you process those shared attributes only once, increasing the efficiency of your vertex shading. Let’s consider the use case of cascaded shadow maps in more detail. Depending on the view distance, a renderer might split its shadow maps into one, two, or three or more overlapping shadow cascades. As we increase the number of cascades, we also increase the size of the virtual world that each cascade covers. This causes the larger, more distant cascades to accumulate more geometry in them, compared to closer cascades. And with more cascades, the number of objects that render into more than one cascade increases. Now let’s consider how cascaded shadow maps are traditionally rendered and the associated costs. Before multi-view rendering, you would simply draw into each cascade separately. This increased both the GPU and CPU overhead. Each vertex must be fetched and shaded multiple times, and each vertex is also output multiple times. Multi-view instance rendering uses the instance ID to map each primitive to its destination view. It eliminates the CPU cost of multiple draw calls, but the GPU cost remains the same. Using instancing for layered rendering also complicates rendering of actual instanced geometry, since instance ID now has to encode both the actual instance ID and the target layer. Vertex amplification eliminates the duplicate fetch, shading, and output. It also provides a separate amplification ID. Let’s take a look at a vertex amplification in action. Existing vertex functions can be easily adapted to vertex amplification. In this example, we’re going to calculate a unique position per amplification, but share the color calculation across all amplifications. We start by declaring our VertexOutput with two attributes. The compiler can usually infer if an attribute is unique or shared, but for complicated shaders, you can also be explicit about which attributes are shared. The compiler will report an error when shared attribute calculations are dependent on amplification ID. Next we declare a function argument holding the amplification ID. Any calculations associated with this ID are amplified per shader invocation. The color attribute is not associated with that ID so it will only be executed once. But the position is dependent on the ID to look up the correct view projection matrix, and so the entire expression is amplified. That’s it for the shader code. Now let's see how we set up the amplified draw calls. Let’s start by creating a pipeline state object that enables amplification. The maximum amplification factor supported by Metal can be queried from the device. In this case, let’s say you want an amplification factor of two. If supported, you set to maximum amplification factor for the pipeline. If not supported, you can fall back to traditional multi-view through instancing or rely on doing multiple draw calls. Finally, you create the pipeline. Once the pipeline is created, and assuming that amplification is supported, you can start to encode your draws. Drawing with amplification requires setting the amplification count and binding the viewMappings. viewMappings describe how to map the amplification ID to target layer or viewport. If the vertex shader also exports a render target or viewport array index, that index will serve as a base offset into the viewMappings array. Now you can set the desired amplification and encode the draws. Let’s take a closer look through the Metal frame debugger. In this sample render, we use VertexAmplification to amplify all the draws that are rendered to both cascades 2 and 3. Here we see that this draw call is rendered with a ViewMapping that specifies two render targets. The mesh is rendered simultaneously into the second cascade shown on the left, and the third cascade, shown both on the right and in the geometry viewer. That’s it for vertex amplification. Let’s move on to argument buffers and how they’ve been extended for the A13. We introduced argument buffers with Metal 2. Argument buffers allow you to encode constants, textures, samplers, and buffer arguments into MTLBuffers.",

This is great when a person wants to focus on your app to get information from their accessory. But what if you wanted to have a complication with information from your accessory? Currently, the complication could not be updated unless a person opened your app. Now in watchOS 8, you can connect your Bluetooth accessory during Background App Refresh. This enables you to update your complications with information from your accessory or send local notification if its battery is running low. With my example temperature sensor, now I can update the temperature in a complication, so I can see it whenever I glance at my watch.

    "video_transcript": "♪ Bass music playing ♪  ♪ Jake Petroules: Hi, and welcome to \"Explore advanced project configuration in Xcode\". I'm Jake, and together with my colleague Prachi, I'll discuss strategies and techniques for making the most of your Xcode project's build configuration. We're going to cover three major topic areas. First, Prachi will discuss multiplatform projects and Xcode 13's new support for multiplatform framework targets. Next, I'll cover best practices for modeling and configuring your project through schemes, target setup and dependency management, and build phases and rules. And finally, Prachi will take you on a deep dive into build settings, where we'll cover their structure and behavior, the project editor UI, configuration settings files and their syntax, and a whole lot more! Throughout this talk, we'll be using a multiplatform app project called Fruta to show how these techniques apply to a real project. And now I'm going to hand it over to Prachi, who's going to talk about multiplatform frameworks. Prachi Pai Asnodkar: Thanks, Jake. One of the new features in Xcode 13 is support for multiplatform frameworks. Multiplatform frameworks allow us to consolidate multiple frameworks into one, providing us simplified target management, one set of build phases to manage, and one set of build settings to manage. Let's take a look at the Fruta app and update our project to take advantage of this feature. This is the Fruta app. It is a multiplatform app that builds for macOS, iOS, and watchOS. It also has three framework targets -- one for each platform that contains a set of shared code used by the apps. Maintaining three separate frameworks can come with challenges, such as keeping build settings in sync, and ensuring all of your source files are properly added to your compile sources build phases. To tackle these challenges, we'll start by converting one of our frameworks to a multiplatform framework. Here we have the three frameworks -- one for each platform. All of these targets are identical except that one has a file which only builds on macOS. First, let's navigate to the Build Settings tab in the project navigator for the macOS framework target. Next, we will configure the framework to build for all platforms by going to the Supported Platforms build setting and choosing Any Platform. You can also see that Allow Multiplatform Builds has been set to \"Yes\" automatically. This informs the build system to build this target once for each of its supported platforms, as necessary. Now that this is a multiplatform target, recall that the original macOS framework had one additional file that should only build when building for macOS. In order to configure our framework to do this, we can add a platform filter to specify that this file should only build for macOS. To do this, we will first go to the Build Phases tab. Next, expand the Compile Sources build phase. Finally, configure Ingredient+macOS.swift to build only for macOS by clicking on the Filters item and unchecking everything but macOS. Now that we have our new multiplatform target configured, we can delete the other two variants of our framework, as they are no longer needed. Additionally, because we have only one framework target, we will have to configure all of our apps to link and embed that new target. The macOS app is already configured because we have set up our multiplatform target starting from the macOS one. We can add the new framework to the iOS and watchOS apps by going to the General tab for each of the app targets, and adding the framework to the Frameworks and Libraries build phase. To summarize: we took our macOS framework target and enabled it to build for iOS and watchOS. We customized that framework with a platform filter for our macOS-only source file. And finally, we configured our app targets to link and embed the new single multiplatform framework target. And that's multiplatform targets in Xcode. Now back to Jake, who's going to dive deeper into project configuration. Jake: Thanks, Prachi. I'm going to discuss best practices for modeling and configuring your Xcode project, and show a few things you can do to improve the performance and correctness of your builds. First, let's have a look at build options for the scheme. I'll click the scheme picker, Edit Scheme, then go to the Build section. There's a few simple things I can configure here. For Build Order, we recommend selecting Dependency Order, which will cause targets in your project to build in parallel according to the dependency graph. This can greatly improve multicore build performance and will also get you faster results from continuous integration. In contrast, choosing Manual Order is deprecated and is not recommended. Using this option will slow down your build and can cause cycle errors when the target order listed in the scheme is inconsistent with your project's dependencies. Another important setting in the scheme build options is Find Implicit Dependencies. Checking this option allows Xcode to automatically add dependencies between targets based on the information in your project, such as linker flags in build settings and the names of linked libraries in build phases. This can be especially useful when the related targets are in different projects where you can't normally add an explicit target dependency. If you are using manual dependency order to build targets in a specific order due to the inability to add explicit target dependencies across different projects, enabling Find Implicit Dependencies in conjunction with choosing Dependency Order is often a better solution. Now I'm going to talk about script phases and build rules. I'll select the SmoothieKit target from the project's target list, and then select the Build Phases tab. Here we have a Process Recipes script phase that contains some custom build logic. One of its responsibilities is generating code from a number of recipe files with one output per input, which we process in sequence. Now, you may realize that these computations are completely independent of each other. This presents a performance optimization opportunity that we can take advantage of by running them in parallel. Build rules allow us to do just that. Let's take a look at how we can extract this work into a build rule. I'll go to the Build Rules tab in the project editor for our framework and click the plus button to add a new build rule. Then enter the file pattern \"*.recipe\", which corresponds to the file extension of the file type I want this rule to process. Next, I'll add dependencies to this rule. I don't need to add any additional inputs to the build rule, because it will automatically get each input file it processes as an input. However, I do need to tell the build system the path of the output file that the rule will produce for each file it processes. I'll click the plus button to add a new output file and enter in $(DERIVED_ FILE_ DIR)/$ (INPUT_ FILE _BASE) .compiledrecipe. It's best practice to write generated files under DERIVED_FILE_DIR since this will point to an appropriate location managed by the build system. You should avoid generating output files under the source root. This can interfere with source control and lead to conflicts when running multiple builds simultaneously. Now we, of course, have to copy our script phase code over to the rule. I'll go back to the script phase, and copy out the code where we processed each of the files. Then I'll go back to the rule and paste that in. Remember that rules run once for each input they process. So I'll remove the for loop, replace $RECIPE with $SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE -- which corresponds to the absolute file path of the current input file being processed -- and replace $DERIVED_FILE_DIR/ $RECIPE.compiledrecipe with $SCRIPT_OUTPUT_FILE_0, which refers to the output file path I've entered in the Output Files section below. Don't forget to quote variables to make sure spaces and other special characters in file paths are handled correctly. Great. Now there's one more thing to configure in the rule. I mentioned that rules run once for each input they process. By default, they also run once for each architecture that the target is compiling for. For example, a rule in a Mac app target might run once for arm64 and once for x86_64 times each of its inputs. So if there are four inputs times two architectures, the rule would be invoked eight times. This is useful when the output of the rule is architecture-dependent, such as object code. However, in this case, my rule produces output which is independent of the underlying CPU architecture, so I'm going to uncheck “Run once per architecture”. Lastly, in order for the build system to propagate the input files into the build rule, I'll need to add all of the .recipe files into the Compile Sources build phase of my framework target. I'll go back to Build Phases, expand Compile Sources, and use the plus button to add the recipe files.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ So our goals have always been to build great accessibility into all of our products because many of us navigate our lives in different ways. At Apple, we like to think of accessibility touching four different broad categories-- vision, cognitive, motor, and hearing. And we look at all those segments and try to think about how they impact each product. Are we doing something in this area where we should have a different accommodation? Do we have something that we need a special assistive technology to provide a different way to interact with this device? How do we make the whole world accessible? Every day, we're thinking about accessibility. We care because they push the boundaries of the experience in a way that we can't imagine. If you can create not just a good accessibility experience, but a great accessibility experience, you'll have a fan for life. The Watch is a unique kind of computing platform. It's very personal. It touches your skin. It also has a long history of what its use is for, and what its functions are. To make it something accessible, you really wanna look at-- what is the product supposed to do? What is its core mission of what this is gonna bring value for? So when you look at that for the Watch, that's when we start to realize, like, all right, how do we make this more accessible for someone who's blind? What do we do for someone who's low-vision? And how do we do it on a CPU the size of a postage stamp? Apple developed this product, and the primary focus was to be able to read the time, and so the contrast with the black background with the legible letters was very important. Well, it turns out that was also important for low-vision users, and it's great for the person who needs that accessibility, but it also turns out to be useful for everyone else. So one of the great things about making a product accessible by design is that you do things that you may not think are necessary, and I'm reminded of a story of a woman that I met who had Usher syndrome. So she came to us and said, \"You know, what's really great about the Watch is that I can read the email on this really small screen because all my vision is focused in this central area. It's actually better than having a big screen.\" When you sort of invest in accessibility, you have to look at things from a different perspective, and so that often leads to features that become mainstream over time, and I think the Apple Watch is a great example of showing a lot of those things, from the large-type watch face which was designed for low-vision users but it's available for everybody. Part of the thing about making the Watch accessible is what is the primary function? One of those things was telling the time quickly, and sometimes discreetly, so that's where Taptic Time came into play, which is a feature that we have that allows a user to feel out the time using the haptics played back to them. When we were testing, one of the things that I noticed right away sort of walking around and using the device, if I was mobile, I had to take one hand off of my cane, stop, and then touch my device. And I thought, \"Well, that could be very dangerous, right?\" So one of the things I thought is, \"Man, it would be really great if I could -just raise my hand...\" - 1:04 p.m. - And hear the time, and then I don't have to stop or jeopardize my safety.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, my name is Nat. And I work on Game Technologies at Apple. Thanks for joining me again this year to catch up about game input for iOS, tvOS, and macOS. Today, I’m going to start with a quick recap of both the how and the why for anybody new to game input on Apple platforms. Next, I’m going to show you a new type of virtual game controller, and we’ll write a little code together. Finally, I want to talk about more actual physical controllers and work through some of our new features. So let’s start out with our review. The game controller framework’s goal is making it easy to add support for all different kinds of efficient, low-latency input across Apple platforms. By abstracting input hardware through the common API, the game controller framework lets you write your input code once without having to worry about how input may have been remapped or the differences among specific controllers, keyboards, or pointing devices. On iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS, players can create system-wide and per-application game controller input remappings, which help make your games more customizable and more accessible. And on all platforms, you can build your UI to reflect the symbols and capabilities of the specific controllers the player is holding. So whether your player is on team circle-square-triangle-cross or on team A-B-X-Y, your game UI will look right for them. The basics of the game controller framework is reacting to notifications about different kinds of GCDevice objects connecting and disconnecting and either polling active devices for input state or setting up value-changed handlers to be notified about input state changes. When controllers connect or disconnect from the system, GCController objects are created and removed, and you are sent GCControllerDidConnect and GCControllerDidDisconnect notifications. It’s the same pattern with GCKeyboard objects when keyboards connect or disconnect, and with GCMouse objects when pointing devices connect or disconnect. All you need to do is add an observer to find out when, for example, a GCController objects connects or disconnects. Then it’s up to you whether to set up those change handlers to notify you when input state changes, or to poll the state of the controller elsewhere. This is the same pattern you should use whether it’s a controller, a keyboard, or a pointing device. We’ve seen so many great new games supporting game controllers and huge customer interest in games that support controllers well. That’s why we really want to help people find games that support game controllers. When we know a game supports game controllers, we badge it in the App Store with the Controller Supported badge. That looks like a little thing, right? But it’s something players are looking for if they love using their controllers, and I know it’s a badge I look for. And we’re always on the lookout to curate and promote apps that work great with game controllers. There are multiple sections for games when we discover apps that make game controllers really shine. I can’t guarantee that your app will be chosen for promotion, but when you do a great job with controllers, players will definitely notice. So here’s all you have to do to mark your app’s support. In Xcode, just add the Game Controllers capability. This tags your application’s Info.plist with the game controller capability, and that’s all you need to do before submitting it to the App Store. When your game has this capability, we also know to include it in the per-app customization section of the Game Controller preferences panel. Players love the ability to tweak controls to their liking, and it’s a great way to improve your game’s accessibility. You don’t have to do anything to participate in input remapping, but when you tag your game, players can customize it specifically. Another terrific feature you get for free when you adopt the game controller framework is screenshots and video clips. Players can capture a screenshot or start and stop video clip recordings with a quick touch of the controller’s share button. Here I am playing Fox2.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi. My name is Caleb. I'm a software engineer on the tvOS team. Today, I'm excited to share some great improvements we've made to sign-ins in tvOS 15. We want everyone using Apple TV to be able to get to their content quickly, and with as little friction as possible. That means the process of signing in to your apps should be fluid and painless. One of the most common ways to sign in is by using a password. Users are encouraged to have strong or unique passwords, but these can be frustrating to type. In tvOS 15, we have a great new feature that makes it easier than ever to perform password-based sign-ins in your apps. It starts with the new system sign-in view. This view does a few really important things. First, it provides a consistent sign-in experience across tvOS. Second, it tells users they can use their iPhone or iPad to complete the sign-in. Third, it gives users options for other sign-in types your app may support. I'll talk more about that later. For now, I wanna focus on using your iPhone or iPad to sign in. If a user begins a sign-in in your app, then wakes their iPhone, they'll see a notification like this from the Apple TV. When they tap the notification, iPhone will guide them through the process of signing in. It will suggest a credential from iCloud Keychain. And they can use Face ID to confirm the sign-in. The credential is then sent back to the Apple TV. Now, the app can finish the sign-in and take the user right to their content. I want to take a moment to point out that this is not a text-entry experience. It's a first-class sign-in experience, where both the Apple TV and the iPhone or iPad cooperate to guide the user through the sign-in process. Adopting this new sign-in experience is really easy. There's a high-level API on all Apple platforms that's designed to help people sign in to your apps. It's especially powerful in tvOS 15. With just a little bit of code, you can take full advantage of the great sign-in experience I just showed you. I'd love to walk you through it now. Let's start with configuring your app's associated domains. Associated domains establish a secure link between your app and domain. This allows the Apple TV and the iPhone or iPad to work together to safely suggest credentials to use for signing in. First, make sure the Apple app site association file hosted by your domain lists your tvOS app's application identifier inside the web credentials key.",

But first let's review how audio drivers work today. Prior to macOS Big Sur, an audio server plug-in would need to communicate with a hardware device through a user client to a kernel extension. In macOS Big Sur, the CoreAudio HAL provided support to create an audio server plug-in built on top of a DriverKit Extension. The layer between the plug-in and the dext was the same as with a kext, but security was improved by moving out of the kernel and into user space. For more information on DriverKit, please check out the previous WWDC DriverKit videos. While the current solution allows audio driver development to move out of the kernel, two separate components are still needed to implement a functional hardware audio driver: An audio server plug-in and a driver extension. This complicates development, increases resources, and can increase overhead and latency. Starting in macOS Monterey, you only need a dext, no more plug-in.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, everyone! I'm Prashant, an AVFoundation Engineer. Welcome to WWDC21. In recent years, the popularity of over-the-top streaming services have approached that of linear television. Depending on the market that you're in, your users might actually prefer free ad-supported content over ad-free content that they need to pay for. So if you're interested in including ads and other interstitials in your HLS streams, you've tuned in to the right session. Before we dive in, let's quickly review some of the existing mechanisms for inserting ads in HLS streams. You could perform server side ad insertion using DISCONTINUITY tags. This is a fairly static scheme in that the ad segments are stitched together with the content segments, and this stitching has to be done even before the playlist is vended to the user. As you might imagine, this doesn't allow for late binding of your ad assets where you'd like for an ad to be decisioned as the user is approaching the ad marker or even rebinding, say, when a user navigates to a portion of the video that they've already watched, they're going to see the same ad all over again. Since HLS operates at a segment granularity, transitions to and from ad pods need to happen at segment boundaries. If your ad marker happens to be present in the middle a content segment, you'd have to split up that segment in order to stitch in the ad. Oftentimes, the number of quality tiers would be different between your primary and interstitial assets. In order to stitch the ad together with all the primary quality tiers, the ads would need to be conditioned to match the content encoding. And you'd also want to make sure that the ads use the same codecs as the primary content. And in live streaming scenarios, your packager might have to do a lot of back-end bookkeeping. Your ads and interstitials would mostly be video-on-demand streams. But the packager would have to spool these out on a per-segment basis for the entirety of the ad break. You could also insert ads on the client side. Until now, we didn't have an official recommendation on how this can be done. One of the more popular approaches is to use a two-player scheme where one player would present the primary content while the other would present the interstitials. And transitions are achieved by coordinating playback between the two players and by managing player view hierarchies. While this works well, the issues here are mostly on the performance side. If buffering is not properly coordinated between the two players, pre-fetching your ad would impact the adaptive bit rate performance of the primary content stream. And features like Picture in Picture and AirPlay are really hard to do well with these custom player approaches. This year, we've addressed all these concerns and in general attempted to make ad insertion a lot more simple. We're introducing HLS interstitials where ads are treated as separate assets that can be scheduled onto a program timeline. Ads are no longer stitched in with DISCONTINUITY tags. Instead they remain as self-contained assets that can be referenced via their master playlist. As we'll soon see, this scheme is dynamic, allowing for late binding and even rebinding to your ad inventory. You're no longer constrained to segment boundaries. You could arbitrarily place ads anywhere on the program timeline. HLS interstitials in conjunction with AVKit offers built-in support for navigation restrictions on tvOS. We also have built-in support for AirPlay and Picture in Picture. All your scheduled ads and interstitials will be carried over the AirPlay session. We also coordinate buffering and the use of other system resources between the primary and interstitial players so as to achieve seamless transitions. Now let's take a look at a typical playback flow when we present some video-on-demand content along with ads using HLS interstitials.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, I'm Ari, and today, along with Cameron, I'm excited to introduce you to the world of Shortcuts and talk about how you can design actions that power great experiences in Shortcuts, Siri, and Suggestions. When we think about designing apps, we usually focus on the details of the UI and what the user can see and feel when they're inside of your app. But in this talk, we're going to do something a little different. We're going to focus on experiences that people can have with your app when your app isn't even open. We think that there's a world of opportunity that we can open up by thinking this way. It all starts with a concept we call \"actions.\" An action is a way of representing a task that people can complete with your app. By creating actions, you can let people perform those tasks in new and exciting ways. Let's say you make the Calendar app. What are some of the most common things people do when they're inside of the Calendar app? Well, people probably add new events, look up existing events, and make changes to events. Those are all great ideas for actions. So, the Calendar app can define an action for each one of those activities. This is where the magic begins. Once the Calendar app creates these actions, people can use them as building blocks to form shortcuts. For example, this Add New Event action is great for quickly adding events to my calendar. People can customize actions, like by setting this one to create events called \"Yoga\" from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. The action can then become a shortcut, which people can use to perform the action whenever they want, in a single tap. People can also mix and match different actions together to form a shortcut that does something even more powerful, like finding all your Calendar events for today and adding a personal meeting room URL to each one. That can form another super valuable shortcut. And people can use actions from different apps together to get even more done in a single shortcut, like this one that gets my next Calendar event and sends a message to the attendees saying I'll be running late.",

Design can be certainly how something looks, but we are really preoccupied with how something works. App and game design enables our device to be what it is and what it can become in your hands. ♪ ♪ Designing an app or a game is actually quite an intimate experience. I need to empathize. I need to have some-- try and understand what your experience might be like using that thing. The person on the other side really can feel the attention and care that's been put into it, but the challenge there is simplifying it so that somebody can look at something and just, like, you know, understand immediately. Developers, the ones that figure out a way to achieve these things in their design are the ones that usually stand out. ♪ ♪ For us to celebrate the best of the best, those apps that were designed in such a way that are deserving of an Apple Design Award, you know, nothing is bigger in this community, in our community. It's always easy to remember the really big moments in life, and winning an Apple Design Award was definitely one of those moments that I'll never forget. I mean, I had to pinch myself, like, really hard to be assured that I'm not dreaming. Pretty much everyone that win Apple Design Award is somebody who has made something that I would use or play. It really gave the team a chance to pause and reflect and acknowledge all that we'd accomplished. It's elevated it to this other level where we've just got a lot more users, and we get a ton of feedback from people in all different countries. I can't say it's more like a dream come true because I-- this was beyond my dream and really can't express those things. This year with the Apple Design Awards, we're bringing back categories. There are six categories for the Apple Design Awards this year. -They're inclusivity. - Delight and fun. - Interaction. - Social impact. - Visuals and graphics. - And innovation. The thing that I love about what we're doing this year is that we're able to really zero in on some particular qualities that are really important and to talk about them directly. ♪ ♪ Apps and games are hugely powerful because they can create environments where, you know, all are welcome. ♪ ♪ Design is inherently about understanding and catering towards people, so this idea of inclusivity, it's not anything new, but it is just making sure that the goal is always to support more people, to enable more people. Well, obviously ethnicity and age and gender are some of the big ones, but all the time, we're finding more things that are personally important to people. Being inclusive and being diverse is being accepting of those categories and making sure that they're represented in a way that's equitable to the user. Apps and games that excel at inclusivity include as many people as possible in the experience. This can be done through localization with a ton of languages. It can be done by supporting a wide variety of accessibility features like voiceover and dynamic type. It can be something as simple as turning on reduced motion in a game so people with motion sensitivities can still have fun and experience the game fully. ♪ ♪ The winning app in the Inclusivity category is Voice Dream Reader. Voice Dream Reader makes it so easy to bring text to speech. Mr. Bennet was so odd. A mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humor, reserve, and caprice... It has probably one of the best implementations of voiceover that we have ever seen. It has a lot of text customization settings, so it can increase contrast or decrease contrast, space out lines, words, and highlight certain phrases within a written material to make it easy for people who may have low vision or dyslexia, and it's also localized into 26 different languages.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi, and welcome to \"Classify Hand Poses and Actions with Create ML.\" I'm Nathan Wertman. And today, I'll be joined by my colleagues, Brittany Weinert and Geppy Parziale. Today, we're going to be talking about classifying hand positions. But before we dig into that, let's talk about the hand itself. With over two dozen bones, joints, and muscles, the hand is an engineering marvel. In spite of this complexity, the hand is one of the first tools infants use to interact with the world around them. Babies learn the basics of communication using simple hand movements before they are able to speak. Once we learn to speak, our hands continue to play a role in communication. They shift to adding emphasis and expression. In the past year, our hands have become more important than ever to bring people closer. In 2020, the Vision Framework introduced Hand Pose Detection, which allows developers to identify hands in the frame, as well as each of the 21 identifiable joints present in the hand. This is a great tool if you are trying to identify if a hand exists or where a hand is in the frame, but it can be a challenge if you're trying to classify what the hand is doing. While the expressive capabilities of the hand are limitless, for the rest of this session, I'd like to focus on short, single-handed poses, like stop, and quiet, and peace, and short, single-handed actions, like back up, go away, and come here. I just referred to hand poses and actions. How about some more concrete definitions? Well, on the one hand, we have poses, which are meaningful as a still image. Even though these two videos are paused, the intent of the subject is clearly expressed. Think of a pose like an image. And on the other hand, we have an action, which requires movement to fully express meaning. The meaning of these two actions is unclear. Looking at a single frame simply isn't sufficient. But with a series of frames over time, like a video or a live photo, the meaning of the action is obvious. A friendly \"hello\" and \"come here.\" With that cleared up, I'm excited to introduce two new Create ML templates this year, Hand Pose Classification and Hand Action Classification. These new templates allow you to train Hand Pose and Action models using either the Create ML app or the Create ML framework. These models are compatible with macOS Big Sur and later, as well as iOS and iPadOS 14 and later.",

Today, I'm going to show you how to create custom audio experiences for your app with ShazamKit using custom catalog recognition. On this session, I'm going to use some of the existing ShazamKit concepts, such as catalogs, signatures, and media items. If you're not already familiar with those, make sure to check out the \"Explore ShazamKit\" talk. Let's take a look at what we will be covering today. We will talk about how to build catalogs with custom audio and metadata. We will learn how you can match audio to your own custom catalog when using the microphone and the AVFAudio framework to record audio. Then we are going to customize our app to synchronize content to the custom audio. Finally, we will cover some of the best practices that you can use when working with custom catalogs. This is a code-along. There is a project available on the developer portal that we will be using throughout this session. I recommend that you download the project before we begin. As learning becomes increasingly more digital, we need to come up with ways to keep children engaged. What if you could play a video on your Apple TV and have a companion app that displays questions at exactly the right time? Today, I'm going to show you how to build a remote app that synchronizes and reacts to an educational video using custom catalog recognition. First, what are custom catalogs exactly, and how do we build one? Custom catalog is a collection of signatures that you generate from any audio. You can also add associated metadata for each signature. To add signatures to your custom catalog, you can use the SignatureGenerator object. It will convert audio buffers into a signature. First, create a signature generator, then using the installTap function on the audioEngine's inputNode, append the buffer and the audioTime to the generator. The buffer parameter is a buffer of audio captured from the output of the inputNode. audioTime is the time when the buffer was captured. When you specify the audioFormat make sure that the format is PCM in one of the supported sample rates. Calling the signature function on the generator will convert the audio buffers into a signature. We call this the reference signature, which we can then add to a custom catalog. You can also add signatures to a catalog by using a shazamsignature file. This is an opaque file that can be shared across devices. To make it easier adopting custom catalogs with ShazamKit, for this session we included this file for you to use. Before we begin, let's open the downloaded project and see what we have in there. Let's take a close look at the Question object.",

    "video_transcript": "♪ ♪ Hi. My name is Linda Dong. I'm a Design Evangelist, and I'm going to be joined shortly by Sam Iglesias, a Prototyper on the Apple Design Team. We're gonna talk about best practices when it comes to designing inclusively. But before we get into that, I wanted to touch on why we make apps and games. As a developer, the things you create bring people joy, enrichment, and convenience. They help us accomplish tasks and reach personal goals. They connect us with other people from around the world. They entertain us through fun gameplay or make us thoughtful through touching narratives. At the end of the day, they add emotional and practical value to our lives. And I'm sure one of the goals you have for your app or game is enabling as many people as possible to enjoy these benefits. Over the years, the App Store has grown into a huge marketplace that serves 500 million visitors per week. People from over 175 regions around the world and 40 different languages can potentially see what you've built. If you want to reach even a fraction of that audience, you owe it to yourself to design with inclusivity in mind, so that your app or game is great for everyone. This means that people can interact with your design through different languages and accessibility features. That it's easy to learn, feels natural, and is a pleasure to use. But great usability isn't the only important goal. What also matters is that your app or game is welcoming and respectful of folks from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Our perspectives are shaped by a number of factors, such as our individual experiences. This could be where we grew up in the world and where we live now, the cultures we're familiar with, and the languages we speak or hear around us. They're also shaped by our human characteristics, like our gender, our age, and the physical and mental abilities and disabilities we might have. You can think of each of these factors as its own diversity axis, and the intersection of where someone lands on all these axes makes up their unique identity. It's a good reminder to think critically about how people with completely different identities and perspectives will all be able to enjoy what you've built. When someone approaches your app or game, they should feel like you designed with them in mind. Not only will people feel taken care of, you'll build trust that extends to other areas of your app, game, and brand. One of the great things about being in your position is that you're in charge of how accommodating your designs will be for people. It does take work and consideration, and you're not always gonna get it right, but any intentional steps you take will be appreciated by so many people.",
